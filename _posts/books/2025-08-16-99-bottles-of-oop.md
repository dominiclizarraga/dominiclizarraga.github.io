In my journey to improve my testing skills I found this [Thoughtbot ebook](https://books.thoughtbot.com/assets/testing-rails.pdf) 

1. [Introduction.](#chapter-1)
2. [Pending.](#chapter-2)

Writing code is the process of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself. You don’t know the answer in advance, but instead, you are seeking it.

This book documents every step down every path of code, and so provides a guided-tour of the
decisions made along the way. It not only shows how good code looks when it’s done, it reveals
the thoughts that produced it.

### Introduction.


### Rediscovering simplicity. {#chapter-1}

Experience has taught you that
most code will someday change, and you’ve begun to craft it in anticipation of that day. Complexity seems both natural and inevitable.

Where you once optimized code for understandability, you now focus on its changeability. Your
code is less concrete but more abstract—you’ve made it initially harder to understand in hopes
that it will ultimately be easier to maintain.
