Recently, I participated in a very competitive interview. When I submitted the code challenge, I felt my weakest area was the testing suite. Even though feedback was not available, being honest with myself and seeing some posts from the reviewers, I decided to dive deeper into testing. 

I picked up books like [Professional Rails Testing by Jason Swett](/2025/02/05/professional-rails-testing.html), [Hands-On Test Driven Development by Greg Donald](/2025/03/16-hands-on-tdd-rails.html), Effective Testing with RSpec by Myron Marston and Ian Dees and even attended a [testing workshop by Lucian Ghinda](https://goodenoughtesting.com/).

I had practiced testing before, but I felt it was time to level up and get it closer to the same standard as the rest of my code.

Here are the notes, examples, and quotes that stood out to me while reading.

### Part I ‚Äî Chapter 1. Getting Started. {#chapter-1}

Picture of the book!

Where should i put this testing heuristics  Given-When-Then scenarios

The forward is written by Tom Stewart author of [Understanding Computation](https://computationbook.com/) And he expresses something that picked my curiosity: 

> After all, the big challenge of test-driven development is not knowing how to write tests, but knowing how to listen to them. For your tests to be worth the bites they are written in, they must be able to speak to you about how well the underlying program is designed and implemented and, crucially, you must be able to hear them. The words and ideas baked into RSpec are carefully chosen to heighten your sensitivity to this kind of feedback. As you play with its expressive little pieces you will develop a test for what a good test looks like, and the occasional stumble over a test that now seems harder or uglier or way more annoying than necessary will start you on a journey of discovery that leads to a better design for that part of your code base.‚Äù

In the introduction we see different quotes like our tests are broken again! Why does the suite take so long to run? What value are we getting from this test anyway?
No matter whether you are new to automated tests or helping using them for years, this book will help you write more effective tests. by effective, we mean tests that give you more value than the time spent writing them.

This book you will learn RSpec  in three phases:

Part I: Introductory exercises to get you acquainted with respect
Part II: A work example spanning several chapters, so that you can see RSpecin action on a meaningful sized project
Part III-V:  A series of deep dives into specific aspects of RSpec, which will have you get the most out of RSpec

RSpec and behavior driven development:

RSpec bills itself as a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) test framework. I would like to take a moment to talk about our use of that term, along with the related term, Test Driven Development (TDD).

With TDD, you write each test case just before implementing the next bit of behavior. When you have a well written test, you wind up with more maintainable code. you can make changes with the confidence that your test suite will let you know if you have broken something.

It is about the way they enable fearless improvements to your design.

BDD brings the emphasis to where it is supposed to be: <b> your code's behavior. </b> 

RSpec is a productive Ruby test framework. we say productive because everything about it, its style, api, libraries, and settings are designed to support you as you write great software.

We have a specific definition of effective here, <b>does this test pay for the cost of writing and running it?</b> A good test will provide at least one of these benefits:

- design guidance:  helping you distill all those fantastic ideas in your head into running, maintainable code

- safety net: finding errors in your code before your customers do

- documentation:capturing the behavior of a working system to help it's maintainers 

As you follow along through the examples in this book, you will practice several habits that will help you test effectively:

When you describe precisely what you want your program to do, you avoid being too strict ( and failing when an irrelevant detail changes)  or too lax (and getting false Confidence from incomplete tests).

By writing your specs to report failure at the right level of detail, you give just enough information to find the cause of the problem, without drawing in excessive output.

By clearly separating essential test code from noisy setup code, you communicate what's exactly expected of the application, and you avoid repeating unnecessary detail.

When you reorder, profile, and filter your specs, you unearth order dependencies, slow tests and incomplete work.

Installing RSpec.

It is made of three independent ruby gems:

`rspec-core`:  is the overall test harness that runs your specs.

`rspec-expectations`:  provides a readable, powerful Syntax for checking properties of your code.

`rspec-mocks`:  makes it easy to isolate the code you are testing from the rest of the system.

Note: The book suggests to use `gem install rspec` however I think it's important to remember that, that command will install the library globally to that Ruby version so if you want to avoid that and narrow the impact that this installation may have, I suggest to create its own directory and use `bundle init`  which will create a `Gemfile` and then you can add `rspec gem` to the  `Gemfile` or use `bundle add rspec`. This will set this `rspec` version only to this project.

Let‚Äôs write our first spec üòÅ

The book starts with the very simple example of building a sandwich. What's the most important property of a sandwich? the bread? the condiments? No, the most important thing about a sandwich is that it should taste good.

RSpec uses the words `describe` a `it` to express concepts in a conversational format:

- ‚ÄúDescribe an ideal sandwich‚Äù
- ‚ÄúFirst, it is delicious‚Äù 

```ruby
01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb
RSpec.describe ‚ÄúAn ideal sandwich‚Äù do
  it ‚Äúis delicious‚Äù do
    # developers work this way with RSpec all the time; they start with an outline and fill it in as they go. 
  end
end

```
Then let‚Äôs add the classes and methods

```ruby
01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb
RSpec.describe ‚ÄúAn ideal sandwich‚Äù do
  it ‚Äúis delicious‚Äù do
    sandwich = sandwich.new(‚Äúit‚Äôs delicious‚Äù, [])

    taste = sandwich.taste

    expect(sandwich). to eq(‚Äúit‚Äôs delicious‚Äù)
  end
end

```
This file defines your test, known in RSpec as your specs, <b>short for a specification (because they specify the desired behavior of your code)</b>. The outer `describe` block creates an example group ‚Äì an example group defines what you are testing, in this case, a sandwich, and keeps related specs together.

The nested block, the one beginning with `it`, is an example of the sandwich‚Äôs use. As you write specs, you will tend to keep each example focused on one particular size of behavior you are testing.

>This first paragraphs reminds me of Jason Swett's book on how many times he stresses to the readers that tests are a specifications not validations! I was able to count at least 8 times that he mentions that for example:
<b>A specification is a statement of how some aspect of a software product should behave.</b> 
<b>Remember that testing is about a specification, not verification. </b> 
<b>A test suite is a structured collection of behavior specifications.</b> 

Differences between tests, specs and examples:

‚Ä¢ A test validates that a bit of code is working properly. 
‚Ä¢ A spec describes the desired behavior of a bit of code. 
‚Ä¢ An example shows how a particular API is intended to be used.

In the bits of code that we wrote we can clearly see the pattern arrange/act/assert.

The last line with the `expect` keyword is the assertion in other test frameworks. Let‚Äôs look at the RSpec methods we‚Äôve used:

‚Ä¢ `RSpec.describe` creates an example group (set of related tests).
‚Ä¢ `it` creates an example (individual test).
‚Ä¢ `expect` verifies an expected outcome (assertion).

Up to this point this spec serves two purposes: documenting what your sandwich should do and checking that the sandwich does what it is supposed to. (Lovely, isn‚Äôt it? ü§å) 

Let‚Äôs run the test and see what happens. (We‚Äôll start reading common error tests)

```ruby
$ ‚ûú  rspec-book git:(master) ‚úó bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb

F

Failures:

  1) An ideal sandwich is delicious
     Failure/Error: sandwich = Sandwich.new("delicious", [])
     
     NameError:
       uninitialized constant Sandwich
     # ./01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb:8:in 'block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.00539 seconds (files took 0.09368 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb:6 # An ideal sandwich is delicious
```

Here we can see that RSpec gives us a detailed report showing us the line of code where the error occurred, and the description of the problem, in this case sandwich has not been initialized.

With this we are following Red/Green/Refactor development practice essential to TDD and BDD. With this workflow, you‚Äôll make sure each example catches failing or missing code before you implement the behavior you‚Äôre testing.

The next step after writing a failing spec is to make it pass.

```ruby 
# add to the top of the file 
`Sandwich = Struct.new(:taste, :toppings)`  # more about [Structs official docs](https://rubyapi.org/3.4/o/struct) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25873672/ruby-class-vs-struct)
# re-run the tests
```

You should see now a green dot ‚Äú.‚Äù and 0 failures

```ruby
‚ûú  rspec-book git:(master) ‚úó bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb

.

Finished in 0.00578 seconds (files took 0.07271 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

Let‚Äôs add a second spec!

```ruby
Sandwich = Struct.new(:taste, :toppings)
RSpec.describe "An ideal sandwich" do
  it "is delicious" do
    # Developers work this way with RSpec all the time; they start with an outline and fill it in as they go
    sandwich = Sandwich.new("delicious", [])

    taste = sandwich.taste

    expect(taste).to eq("delicious")
  end

  it "lets me add toppings" do
    # Developers work this way with RSpec all the time; they start with an outline and fill it in as they go
    sandwich = Sandwich.new("delicious", [])

    sandwich.toppings << "cheese"
    toppings = sandwich.toppings

    expect(toppings).not_to be_empty
  end
end
```
This example shows 2 new features, check for falsehood (using `.not_to` instead of `.to`) and check for data structure attributes

But also they are repetitive, let‚Äôs introduce 3 new RSpec features:

‚Ä¢ RSpec `hooks` run automatically at specific times during testing.
‚Ä¢ `Helper methods` are regular Ruby methods; you control when these run.
‚Ä¢ RSpec‚Äôs `let` construct initializes data on demand.

To avoid the repetitiveness that the prior code shows, let's start using what we described previously hooks, helper methods, let. 

Hooks

The first thing that we will try in our test Suite is a before hook, which will run automatically before each example. (it reminds me to [ActiveRecord callbacks](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_callbacks.html)) 

```ruby
RSpec.describe "An ideal sandwich" do
  before { @sandwich = Sandwich.new("delicious", []) } 
  it "is delicious" do
    taste = @sandwich.taste

    expect(taste).to eq("delicious")
  end

  it "lets me add toppings" do
    @sandwich.toppings << "cheese"
    toppings = @sandwich.toppings

    expect(toppings).not_to be_empty
  end
end
```

The setup code is shared across specs, but the individual Sandwich instance is not. Every example gets its own sandwich. That means that you can add toppings as you do in the second spec, with the confidence that the changes won't affect other examples.

<div style="text-align: center;">RSpec keeps track of all the hooks you have registered. Each time RSpec is about to start running one of your examples, it will run any `before` hooks that apply.  `hooks` are great for running, setup code that has real-world side effects. If you need to clear out a test database before each example, a hook is a great place to do so.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Here are some drawbacks from `hooks`:  First, If you misspelled `@sandwich`, Ruby will silently return `nil` instead of aborting with a failure right away. The result is typically a confusing error message. Second, to refactor your specs to use instance variables, you have had to go through the entire file and replace `sandwich` with `@sandwich`. Finally, when you initialize an instance variable maybe `before hook`, you pay the cost of that setup time for all the examples in the group even if some of them never use the instance variable. That is inefficient and can be quite noticeable.</div>

 Let's try a different approach. (a more traditional Ruby approach)

RSpec does a lot for us; it is easy to forget that it is just playing Ruby underneath. Each example group is a ruby class, which means that we can define methods on it. 

```ruby
RSpec.describe "An ideal sandwich" do
  def sandwich
    @sandwich ||= Sandwich.new("delicious", [])
  end
  it "is delicious" do
    taste = sandwich.taste

    expect(taste).to eq("delicious")
  end

  it "lets me add toppings" do
    sandwich.toppings << "cheese"
    toppings = sandwich.toppings

    expect(toppings).not_to be_empty
  end
end
```
A typical Ruby implementation might look something like the one we just wrote which uses memoization.

This pattern is pretty easy to find in Ruby but it is not without its pitfalls. the `||=` operator works by seeing if `@sandwich` is falsey, that is, `false` or `nil`, before creating a new `@sandwich`. That means that it won't work if we are actually trying to store something `falsey`.

Sharing objects with `let`

RSpec gives us an alternative construct, `let`. Which handles the edge case that we previously discussed with `memoization`.

You can think of `let` as assigning a name ‚Äî in this case, `:sandwich` ‚Äî to the result of a block. This block is lazily evaluated, meaning RSpec will only run it the first time `:sandwich` is accessed within an example. The result is then memoized (cached) for the remainder of that example.

Our recommendation is to use these code-sharing techniques where they improve maintainability, lesson noise, and increase clarity. 

```ruby
RSpec.describe "An ideal sandwich" do
  let (:sandwich) { Sandwich.new("delicious", []) } # [let official docs](https://rspec.info/features/3-13/rspec-core/helper-methods/let/)
  it "is delicious" do
    taste = sandwich.taste

    expect(taste).to eq("delicious")
  end

  it "lets me add toppings" do
    sandwich.toppings << "cheese"
    toppings = sandwich.toppings

    expect(toppings).not_to be_empty
  end
end
```
[Claude convo about let](https://claude.ai/chat/b5733d6a-d842-406b-83bc-d7ebc98008b5)

At the end of the chapter there is a ‚ÄúYour turn‚Äù section where the author encouraged you to respond a couple of questions and for the first chapter they asked the following:
 Which of the three ways to reduce duplication that we have shown to you do you like the best for this example? Why? Can you think of situations where the others might be a better option?

As all good engineering questions it depends as we have seen the first one which was the before hook, it is very clean, it reads good however we saw that it has some drawbacks, like it would return `nil` if the instance variable is misspelled  and all the refactor gymnastics that it implies for refactoring just one file even when the instance variable is not used in a group example. Then the `helper method` has the memoization problem and finally they `let` alternative covers those issues. 

Some extra coding for solidifying `let` knowledge:

```ruby
RSpec.describe "An ideal sandwich" do
  let(:sandwich) { Sandwich.new("delicious", []) }
  
  it "is delicious" do
    puts "Example 1 - Sandwich object_id: #{sandwich.object_id}"
    # Example 1 - Sandwich object_id: 1232
    taste = sandwich.taste
    expect(taste).to eq("delicious")
  end

  it "lets me add toppings" do
    puts "Example 2 - Sandwich object_id: #{sandwich.object_id}"
    # Example 2 - Sandwich object_id: 1240
    sandwich.toppings << "cheese"
    toppings = sandwich.toppings
    expect(toppings).not_to be_empty
  end
end

# within same group example

it "uses the same object within one example" do
  puts "First call: #{sandwich.object_id}"
  # First call: 1248
  sandwich.toppings << "cheese"
  
  puts "Second call: #{sandwich.object_id}"  # Same object!
  # Second call: 1248
  expect(sandwich.toppings).to include("cheese")  # Cheese is still there
end
```
A recap of Chapter 1: We explored the `describe` block, which is called on a group of examples, and the `it` block, which is called an example (or a test case in some other testing frameworks). We covered the `expect` keyword. We also looked at the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. We thoroughly read through test failures and what they mean.

We understood that testing serves two purposes: documenting what the code should do, and checking that the code does what it‚Äôs supposed to do. We explored how to negate an expectation, and how to test collections such as arrays and hashes. Finally, we saw three different ways of reducing code in tests: `hooks`, Ruby helper methods, and the `let` construct.

### Part I ‚Äî Chapter 2. From writing specs to running them. {#chapter-2}

```ruby
# Add the next file 01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb
class Coffee
  def ingridients
    @ingridients ||= []
  end

  def add(ingridient)
    ingridients << ingridient
  end

  def price
    1.00
  end
end

RSpec.describe "A cup of coffee" do
  let(:coffee) { Coffee.new }
  it "costs $1" do
    expect(coffee.price).to eq(1)
  end

  context "with milk" do
    before { coffee.add :milk }

    it "costs $1.25" do
      expect(coffee.price).to eq(1.25)
    end
  end
end
```
And in this chapter we explore the `--format documentation`
```ruby
‚ûú  rspec-book git:(master) bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01 --format documentation

A cup of coffee
  costs $1
  with milk
    costs $1.25 (FAILED - 1)

An ideal sandwich
  is delicious
  lets me add toppings

Failures:

  1) A cup of coffee with milk costs $1.25
     Failure/Error: expect(coffee.price).to eq(1.25)
     
       expected: 1.25
            got: 1.0
     
       (compared using ==)
     # ./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb:25:in 'block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.01762 seconds (files took 0.08827 seconds to load)
4 examples, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb:24 # A cup of coffee with milk costs $1.25
```
Another suggestion from the book is adding the [gem coderay](https://github.com/rubychan/coderay) which highlights with different colors the line that is failing. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex tests suites.
`bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01 -fd` (see the `expect` and `1.25`)

<div><img src='/../graphics/projects/coderay_gem_syntax_highlight.png' alt='highlight_syntax_by_coderay_gem' style="width:400px;"/></div>

Another tool that is shown in this chapter is how to identify a slow test by adding `--profile n` (n is the number of offenders we‚Äôd like to see)

```ruby 
# 01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb
RSpec.describe "The sleep() method" do
  it("can sleep for 0.1 seconds") { sleep 0.1 }
  it("can sleep for 0.2 seconds") { sleep 0.2 }
  it("can sleep for 0.3 seconds") { sleep 0.3 }
  it("can sleep for 0.4 seconds") { sleep 0.4 }
  it("can sleep for 0.5 seconds") { sleep 0.5 }
end

# $ bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01 -fd --profile 2
The sleep() method
  can sleep for 0.1 seconds
  can sleep for 0.2 seconds
  can sleep for 0.3 seconds
  can sleep for 0.4 seconds
  can sleep for 0.5 seconds

Top 2 slowest examples (0.90852 seconds, 58.8% of total time):
  The sleep() method can sleep for 0.5 seconds
    0.50321 seconds ./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb:6
  The sleep() method can sleep for 0.4 seconds
    0.40531 seconds ./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb:5


Finished in 1.54 seconds (files took 0.0894 seconds to load)
5 examples, 0 failures
```
Also this chapter covers how to run specific tests when you don‚Äôt need to run the whole test suite (from directories, to files to even just examples).

```ruby 
$ rspec spec/unit/specific_spec.rb # Load just one spec file
$ rspec spec/unit spec/foo_spec.rb # Or mix and match files and directories
```

Example for running examples that contains word ‚Äúmilk‚Äù (searches are
case-sensitive)

```ruby
$ bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01 -e milk -fd 
Run options: include {full_description: /milk/}

A cup of coffee
  with milk
    costs $1.25 (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) A cup of coffee with milk costs $1.25
     Failure/Error: expect(coffee.price).to eq(1.25)
     
       expected: 1.25
            got: 1.0
     
       (compared using ==)
     # ./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb:25:in 'block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.0128 seconds (files took 0.06799 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```
And if you need to run only one example or test case, you can pass `rspec 01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb:25` and RSpec will run the example that starts on that line.

Rerunning Everything That Failed

There is one RSpec command that allows you to run just exactly the failing specs, this is pretty useful as the last command because you avoid running the whole test suite and you can fix one spec, rerun it, fix the next one and so on let's dive in 

```ruby
# here we can see that same error is being brought up, example: `with milk costs $1.25`
‚ûú  rspec-book git:(master) ‚úó bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01/
.F.......

Failures:

  1) A cup of coffee with milk costs $1.25
     Failure/Error: expect(coffee.price).to eq(1.25)
     
       expected: 1.25
            got: 1.0
     
       (compared using ==)
     # ./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb:29:in 'block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 1.55 seconds (files took 0.08332 seconds to load)
9 examples, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb:28 # A cup of coffee with milk costs $1.25

```
Then we add the command `--only-failures` at the end and this will ask us for a path to write the last run diagnosis, in this case we added:

```ruby
‚ûú rspec-book git:(master) ‚úó bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01/ --only-failures

To use `--only-failures`, you must first set `config.example_status_persistence_file_path`.

#  add this config line

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.example_status_persistence_file_path = 'spec/examples.txt'
end
```
Which will add a spec/examples.txt file with details as the following:

example_id                                         | status | run_time        |
-------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb[1:1]   | passed | 0.00064 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/coffee_spec.rb[1:2:1] | failed | 0.01486 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb[1:1] | passed | 0.00007 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/sandwich_spec.rb[1:2] | passed | 0.00163 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb[1:1]     | passed | 0.10517 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb[1:2]     | passed | 0.20549 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb[1:3]     | passed | 0.30431 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb[1:4]     | passed | 0.40278 seconds |
./01-getting-started/01/spec/slow_spec.rb[1:5]     | passed | 0.50561 seconds |

Finally, when we re-run the `--only-failures` it will search for that ‚Äúfailed status‚Äù and run only that one! You can see it below:

```ruby
‚ûú  rspec-book git:(master) ‚úó bundle exec rspec 01-getting-started/01/ --only-failures
Run options: include {last_run_status: "failed"} üëà
F

Failures:

  1) A cup of coffee with milk costs $1.25
     Failure/Error: expect(coffee.price).to eq(1.25)
     
       expected: 1.25

This chapter focused on how specs should look and how they can be run.
It began with the introduction of the `context` block, which is an alias for `describe`. However, it has a more specific and useful purpose: it's often used for phrases that describe a particular state or condition of the object being tested.

We learned about the command `rspec --format documentation` or `--f d`, which separates group examples from individual examples and adds indentation to visually show nesting‚Äîsuch as one or two levels deep.

We also explored the gem called coderay, which adds color to test output, making it easier to scan for failures. Additionally, we covered the command `rspec --profile 2`, which helps identify the slowest-running tests.

Next, we learned about the `rspec --example word` command, which allows us to run only the group examples or examples that match the given word.

Then, we explored how to run a specific test by including the line number in the command, like so:
`rspec ./spec/coffee_spec.rb:25`.

We also discovered a very useful command: `rspec --only-failures`. This runs only the tests that failed in the previous run by using a file that stores the status of each example.

We then looked into running tests in focused mode‚Äîallowing us to run only specific `context`, `it`, or `describe` blocks by tagging them. We can assign custom tags and then pass those tags when running rspec to filter the examples accordingly.

Another feature we explored was how to sketch out the test suite when you have more ideas in mind than time to implement them. You can use an `it` block with just a description (without a body), which RSpec treats as `pending`. You can also mark tests as incomplete using `pending`, `skip`, or `xit`.

Finally, we covered the `--next-failure` command, which runs only the next failing test from the previous run.

| Command                                 | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| rspec --format documentation            | Displays test output with indentation to show nesting of examples.         |
| rspec --profile 2                       | Shows the 2 slowest-running tests to help identify performance bottlenecks.|
| rspec --example word                    | Runs only the examples that match the given word.                          |
| rspec ./spec/filename_spec.rb:25        | Runs only the test located on line 25 of the specified file.               |
| rspec --only-failures                   | Runs only the tests that failed in the previous run.                       |
| rspec --next-failure                    | Runs the next failing test from the last run.                              |

### Part I ‚Äî Chapter 3. The RSpec Way. {#chapter-3}

All these prior  features of RSpec are designed to make certain habits easy:
‚Ä¢ Writing examples that clearly spell out the expected behavior of the code
‚Ä¢ Separating common setup code from the actual test logic
‚Ä¢ Focusing on just what you need to do to make the next spec pass

Writing specs isn‚Äôt the goal of using RSpec‚Äîit‚Äôs the benefits those specs provide. Let‚Äôs talk about those benefits now; they‚Äôre not all as obvious as ‚Äúspecs catch bugs.‚Äù

- Specs increase confidence in your project
	‚Ä¢ The ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù through a particular bit of code behaves the way you want it to.
‚Ä¢ A method detects and reacts to an error condition you‚Äôre anticipating.
‚Ä¢ That last feature you added didn‚Äôt break the existing ones.
‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre making measurable progress through the project.
- Eliminating fear
	- With broad test coverage, developers find out early if new code is breaking existing features. 
- Enabling refactoring
- Without a good set of specs, refactoring is a daunting task.
- Our challenge as developers is to structure our projects so that big changes are easy and predictable. As Kent Beck says, ‚Äúfor each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change.‚Äù
- Guiding design
- If you write your specs before your implementation, you‚Äôll be your own first client.
- As counterintuitive as it may sound, one of the purposes of writing specs is to cause pain‚Äîor rather, to make poorly designed code painful.
- Sustainability
- RSpec may slow initial development but ensures faster, safer future changes‚Äîunless the project is small, static, or disposable.
- Documenting behavior.
- Transforming your workflow
	- Each run of your suite is an experiment you‚Äôve designed in order to validate (or refute) a hypothesis about how the code behaves.
- You get fast, frequent feedback when something doesn‚Äôt work, and you can change course immediately

Running the entire suite
Consider the difference between a test suite taking 12 seconds and one taking 10 minutes. After 1,000 runs, the former has taken 3 hours and 20 minutes. The latter has cumulatively taken nearly 7 days.

Deciding what not to test
Every behavior you specify in a test is another point of coupling between your tests and your project code. That means you‚Äôll have one more thing you‚Äôll have to fix if you ever need to change your implementation‚Äôs behavior.

If you do need to drive a UI from automated tests, try to test in terms of your problem domain (‚Äúlog in as an administrator‚Äù) rather than implementation details (‚Äútype admin@example.com into the third text field‚Äù).

Another key place to show restraint is the level of detail in your test assertions. Rather than asserting that an error message exactly matches a particular string (‚ÄúCould not find user with ID 123‚Äù), consider using substrings to match just the key parts (‚ÄúCould not find user‚Äù). Likewise, don‚Äôt specify the exact order of a collection unless the order is important. 

### Part II ‚Äî Building an app with RSpec.

### Part II ‚Äî Chapter 4. Building an App With RSpec. {#chapter-4}

In this chapter authors decide to build an expense tracker app where users can add/search expenses.

It will use [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) as router and not rails since we don't need background workers, mailers, views, asset pipelie and so on.

We need a small JSON APIs and Sinatra will do the job.

<b>Acceptance specs => which checks the behavior of the application as a whole. By the end of the chapter, we‚Äôll have the skeleton of a live app and a spec to test it (It makes me think like a smoke check for the core flow.)</b>

Also, we used a "outside-in development" which means start working at outermost layer (the HTTP request/response cycle) and work your way inward to the classes and methods that contain the logic.

Create a directory and add `bundler`

```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/

# add ENV['RACK_ENV'] = 'test' to spec_helper.rb

# add bundler as package manager
`bundle init`

# then in the Gemfile file add the next gems
gem "rspec", "~> 3.13"
gem "coderay" # easy-to-read, syntax-highlighted
gem 'rack-test' # provide an API for tests
gem 'sinatra' # implement the web application

# then run `bundle install` and `bundle exec rspec --init`, which will create:
`.rspec` # contains rspec command line flags
`spec/spec_helper.rb` # contains configuration options

```

It‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed as we‚Äôre deciding what to test first. Where do we start?

 <b>What‚Äôs thecore of the project? What‚Äôs the one thing we agree our API should do? It should faithfully save the expenses we record.</b>

We‚Äôre only going to use two of the most basic features of HTTP in these examples:
‚Ä¢ A `GET` request reads data from the app.
‚Ä¢ A `POST` request modifies data.

First testing run üèÉ

```ruby
require 'rack/test'
require 'json'

module ExpenseTracker
  RSpec.describe 'Expense Tracker API' do
    include Rack::Test::Methods

    it 'records submitted expenses' do
      coffee = {
      'payee' => 'Starbucks',
      'amount' => 5.75,
      'date' => '2025-06-10'
      }
      post '/expenses', JSON.generate(coffee) # This will simulate an HTTP POST request (it's a Rack::Test helper)
    end
  end
end
```

In the console we run `bundle exec rspec 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb` and we get the next error:

```ruby
F

Failures:

  1) Expense Tracker API records submitted expenses
     Failure/Error: post '/expenses', JSON.generate(coffee)
     
     NameError:
       undefined local variable or method 'app' for #<RSpec::ExampleGroups::ExpenseTrackerAPI:0x000000011e93b538>
     # ./04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb:14:in 'block (2 levels) in <module:ExpenseTracker>'

Finished in 0.00161 seconds (files took 0.15436 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb:8 # Expense Tracker API records submitted expenses
```

Given error tells us that we cannot use `app` because we have not defined it yet, so let's add it (temporaly with a ruby helper method.)

```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb
    def app
      ExpenseTracker::API.new
    end

    it 'records submitted expenses' do
      ...
    end
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api.rb
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'json'

module ExpenseTracker
  class API < Sinatra::Base # This class defines the barest skeleton of a Sinatra app.
  end
end
```

Now, by adding `ExpenseTracker::API` and the `app` method we‚Äôre verifying only that the `POST` request completes without crashing the app.

Let's check the response

```ruby
F

Failures:

  1) Expense Tracker API records submitted expenses
     Failure/Error: expect(last_response.status).to eq(200)
     
       expected: 200
            got: 404
     
       (compared using ==)
     # ./04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb:21:in 'block (2 levels) in <module:ExpenseTracker>'

Finished in 0.02102 seconds (files took 0.20637 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```

We need to add the route for this:

```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api.rb
  post '/expenses' do
  end
```

Let's fill the body of the response, we start from the testing, in this case parsing the `response`
```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb
  it 'records submitted expenses' do
    coffee = {
      'payee' => 'Starbucks',
      'amount' => 5.75,
      'date' => '2017-06-10'
    }

    post '/expenses', JSON.generate(coffee)
    p last_response
    expect(last_response.status).to eq(200)

    parsed = JSON.parse(last_response.body) üëà
    expect(parsed).to include('expense_id' => a_kind_of(Integer)) üëà
  end
```

Then in our API we are going to fool the response with the following:
```ruby
  # 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api.rb
  post '/expenses' do
    JSON.generate('expense_id' => 42)
  end
```

And as we're inspecting the `last_response` we can see the `@body` contains the hash with key as `expense_id` and value as `42`.

```ruby
-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb
#<Rack::MockResponse:0x000000011db1ba48 @original_headers={"content-type" => "text/html;charset=utf-8", "content-length" => "17", "x-xss-protection" => "1; mode=block", "x-content-type-options" => "nosniff", "x-frame-options" => "SAMEORIGIN"}, @errors="", @status=200, @headers={"content-type" => "text/html;charset=utf-8", "content-length" => "17", "x-xss-protection" => "1; mode=block", "x-content-type-options" => "nosniff", "x-frame-options" => "SAMEORIGIN"}, @writer=#<Method: Rack::MockResponse(Rack::Response::Helpers)#append(chunk) /Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rack-3.1.16/lib/rack/response.rb:359>, @block=nil, @body=["{\"expense_id\":42}"], @buffered=true, @length=17, @cookies={}>
```

Saving expenses is all fine and good, but it‚Äôd be nice to retrieve them. Let's fetch expenses by date.

Let's start by adding more expenses:

```ruby
# within the example 'records submitted expenses' add these 2 hashes
    it 'records submitted expenses' do
      zoo = post_expense(
        'payee' => 'Zoo',
        'amount' => 15.25,
        'date' => '2017-06-10'
      )
  
      groceries = post_expense(
        'payee' => 'Whole Foods',
        'amount' => 95.20,
        'date' => '2017-06-11'
      )
  
      coffee = post_expense(
        'payee' => 'Starbucks',
        'amount' => 5.75,
        'date' => '2017-06-10'
      )

      get '/expenses/2017-06-10'
      expect(last_response.status).to eq(200)

      expenses = JSON.parse(last_response.body)
      expect(expenses).to contain_exactly(coffee, zoo)
    end
```

And as you may see we added the `post_expense(expense)` method, so add it within `describe` block:

```ruby
  def post_expense(expense)
    post '/expenses', JSON.generate(expense)
    expect(last_response.status).to eq(200)

    parsed = JSON.parse(last_response.body)
    expect(parsed).to include('expense_id' => a_kind_of(Integer))
    expense.merge('id' => parsed['expense_id'])
  end
```

When you run the test suite `bundle exec rspec 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb` you should see an error like this:

```ruby
Failures:

  1) Expense Tracker API records submitted expenses
     Failure/Error: expect(expenses).to contain_exactly(coffee, zoo)
     
       expected collection contained:  [{"amount" => 5.75, "date" => "2017-06-10", "id" => 42, "payee" => "Starbucks"}, {"amount" => 15.25, "date" => "2017-06-10", "id" => 42, "payee" => "Zoo"}]
       actual collection contained:    []
       the missing elements were:      [{"amount" => 5.75, "date" => "2017-06-10", "id" => 42, "payee" => "Starbucks"}, {"amount" => 15.25, "date" => "2017-06-10", "id" => 42, "payee" => "Zoo"}]
     # ./04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/expense_tracker_api_spec.rb:47:in 'block (2 levels) in <module:ExpenseTracker>'

Finished in 0.0305 seconds (files took 0.2402 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure
```

And the API endpoint we should enable is the following (`GET '/expenses/:date'`)

```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api.rb
module ExpenseTracker
  class API < Sinatra::Base
    post '/expenses' do
      JSON.generate('expense_id' => 42)
    end

    get '/expenses/:date' do 
      JSON.generate([])
    end
  end
end
```

Now, we can mark the test_case as pending by adding right after the `it` block `pending 'Need to persist expenses'` this will change the red color from our terminal to a more friendly yellow.

And with this warning we can add a webserver gem, in this case add `gem 'rackup'`, `gem 'webrick'` to Gemfile and create a file:
```ruby
 # 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/config.ru # new file üö®
  require_relative 'app/api'
  run ExpenseTracker::API.new

# run `cd 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker` and from that directory [NOT rspec-book] run `bundle exec rackup`
# this will boot up a webserver 
‚ûú  expense_tracker git:(master) ‚úó bundle exec rackup

[2025-07-23 14:29:17] INFO  WEBrick 1.9.1
[2025-07-23 14:29:17] INFO  ruby 3.4.2 (2025-02-15) [arm64-darwin24]

 ```

In another terminal you can try out your server with the following command:

```ruby
‚ûú  rspec-book git:(master) ‚úó curl localhost:9292/expenses/2017-06-10 -w "\n"
[] # this is due to our 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api.rb GET route ‚úÖ
```
To recap of this chapter we began a project about tracking expenses that will register and search them, with only 2 actions. We set up `bundler` since we need more libraries than RSpec, such as Sinatra, SQlite, Rack, WEBrick, etc.

We started with an outside-in approach where we defined the outer layer of the app in this case the `POST` endpoint. We were encouraged to think deeply about the public API and what type of data we wanted back as a response. Then we started building the classes, and we made progress by clearing one error at a time. We used two new matchers `include`, `a_kind_of` and `contain_exactly` which we didn't use but was mentioned and lastly we refactored an method for persisting a Hash of expenses and booted up the web server with `bundle exec rackup`. It's important to mention that all these requests are simulated.

### Part II ‚Äî Chapter 5. Testing in isolation: Unit specs. {#chapter-5}

In this chapter we're going to be picking up where we left off: the HTTP routing layer.

Unit tests typically involve isolating a class or method from the rest of the code. The result is faster tests and easier-to-find errors.

We‚Äôll use unit spec to refer to the fastest, most isolated set of tests for a particular project.

With the unit tests in this chapter, you won‚Äôt be calling methods on the API class directly. Instead, you‚Äôll still be simulating HTTP requests through the Rack::Test interface. <a href="https://rhnh.net/2012/12/20/how-i-test-rails-applications/" target="_blank">Xavier Shay article about how he tests rails apps</a>

Your tests for any particular layer‚Äîfrom customer-facing code down to low-level model classes‚Äîshould drive that layer‚Äôs public API. <b>You‚Äôll find yourself making more careful decisions about what does or doesn‚Äôt go into the API.</b>

The behavior we want to see is - what happens when an API call succeeds and when it fails.

<div style="text-align: center;">Unit tests are great for test all the conditional branches and edge cases very fast on the other hand if we do it with acceptance/integration would be too inefficient.</div>

```ruby
# create a file spec/unit/app/api_spec.rb
require_relative '../app/api'

module ExpenseTracker
  RSpec.describe API do
    describe 'POST /expenses' do
      context 'when the expense is successfully recorded' do
        it 'returns the expense id'
        it 'responds with a 200 (OK)'
      end

      context 'when the expense fails validation' do
        it 'returns an error message'
        it 'responds with a 422 (Unprocessable entity)'
      end
    end
  end
end
```
Hit the console with `bundle exec rspec 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api_spec.rb` all tests should appear as "pending".

We are still modeling the API so we want something like this:

```ruby
result = @ledger.record({ 'some' => 'data' })
result.success? # => a Boolean
result.expense_id # => a number
result.error_message # => a string or nil
```

Remember, we're testing the `API` class, not the behavior.

This is the perfect spot for `test doubles`. <b>A test double is an object that stands in for another one during a test.</b>

To create a stand-in for an instance of a particular class, you‚Äôll use RSpec‚Äôs `instance_double` method, and pass it the name of the class you‚Äôre imitating. <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler's article about test double</a>


Add the follwoing code to file `04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/unit/api_spec.rb`

```ruby
require_relative '../app/api'
require 'rack/test'

module ExpenseTracker
  RecordResult = Struct.new(:success?, :expense_id, :error_message)

  RSpec.describe API do
    include Rack::Test::Methods

    def app
      API.new(ledger: ledger)
    end

    let(:ledger) { instance_double('ExpenseTracker::Ledger') }

    describe 'POST /expenses' do
      context 'when the expense is successfully recorded' do
        it 'returns the expense id'
        it 'responds with a 200 (OK)'
      end

      context 'when the expense fails validation' do
        it 'returns an error message'
        it 'responds with a 422 (Unprocessable entity)'
      end
    end
  end
end
```

As with the acceptance specs, you‚Äôll be using `Rack::Test` to route HTTP requests to the API class. Eventually, we'll move the `RecordResult` class into the codebase.

<b>The seam between layers is where integration bugs hide. Using a simple value object like a `RecordResult` or `Struct` between layers makes it easier to isolate code and trust your tests.</b> <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries" target="_blank">Article related to catching bugs between layers.</a>

üî¶ If you feel a bit lost here is a summary of the 3 files we have written in chapter 5. üîé

`api.rb`: Defines a thin HTTP API (Sinatra app). It‚Äôs the boundary/interface between the outside world and your app logic.

- Parse incoming HTTP requests

- Forward them to your application logic (Ledger object)

- Return an HTTP response (JSON with status codes)

It's like a router/controller in Rails.

`api_spec.rb`: Tests the API in isolation using test doubles, to control its behavior and avoid hitting the database or real logic.

This is a `unit test` for your API layer.

You‚Äôre using an `instance_double` of `Ledger` to isolate the API layer and check:

- Does the API route call ledger.record?

- Does it return the expected response if ledger.record is successful?

- What happens if ledger.record fails?

`expense_tracker_spec.rb`: <b>Acceptance-level (end-to-end) spec.</b> It tests the whole system, using real logic (no doubles), to ensure the full behavior works.

- It sends POST requests with expense data.

- It sends a GET request to retrieve expenses for a given day.

- It checks whether the correct data is returned.

- It tests the full stack: HTTP ‚Üí Sinatra ‚Üí Ledger ‚Üí persistence.

`initialize(ledger:)`: Adds "dependency injection" so the API can be wired up with either real objects (in end-to-end tests) or test doubles (in unit tests).

```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/unit/api_spec.rb

require_relative '../../app/api'
require 'rack/test'

module ExpenseTracker
  RecordResult = Struct.new(:success?, :expense_id, :error_message)

  RSpec.describe API do
    include Rack::Test::Methods

    def app
      API.new(ledger: ledger)
    end

    let(:ledger) { instance_double('ExpenseTracker::Ledger') }

    describe 'POST /expenses' do
      context 'when the expense is successfully recorded' do
        it 'returns the expense id' do
          expense = { 'some' => 'data' }

          allow(ledger).to receive(:record)
                       .with(expense)
                       .and_return(RecordResult.new(true, 417, nil))

          post '/expenses', JSON.generate(expense)
          parsed = JSON.parse(last_response.body)
          expect(parsed).to include('expense_id' => 417)
        end

        it 'responds with a 200 (OK)'
      end

      context 'when the expense fails validation' do
        it 'returns an error message'
        it 'responds with a 422 (Unprocessable entity)'
      end
    end
  end
end
```
The `allow` method configures the test double's behavior: when the call in this case the `API` class invokes `.record` the double will return a new `RecordResult` instance.

Also, please notice that the `expense` hash doesn't contain real data, this is ok since the whole point of the Ledger test double is that it will return a canned success or failure response.

If we run the test at this point we get the following:

```ruby

```

The last excersice is to add `GET /expenses/:date` starting from writing down tests:
- [x] Write the `describe` block, then the `context`, the `it` blocks.
- [x] The `API::Sinatra` is already working (we have not defined the storage engine yet)
- [x] Add `instance_double` of `ledger`(`RecordResult` is no longer needed)
- [x] Add the method `expenses_on(date)` on the `Ledger`class.
- [x] Generate a sample data of the JSON we want as return. (The hash should contain amount, date and payee)
- [x] Modify the `api.rb` since the `GET` route always return empty array. It shoudl handle success and failure too.

Here is the `api.rb` and the `api_spec.rb`. These refactored specs report "just the facts" of the expected behavior.

```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/app/api.rb
  get '/expenses/:date' do
    date = params[:date]

    unless /\A\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\z/.match?(date)
      status 400
      return JSON.generate({ error: "Invalid date format" })
    end

    expenses = @ledger.expenses_on(date)
    if expenses.any?
      JSON.generate(expenses)
    else
      JSON.generate([])
    end
  end
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/unit/api_spec.rb

    def app
      API.new(ledger: ledger)
    end

    let(:ledger) { instance_double('ExpenseTracker::Ledger') }

    describe "GET /expenses/:date" do
      context "when expenses exist on given date" do
        let(:expense_canned_response) { [ {"amount" => 5.50, "date" => '2017-06-10', "payee" => "Starbucks"} ] }

        before do
          allow(ledger).to receive(:expenses_on)

        end

        it "responds with a 200 (OK)" do
          get '/expenses/2017-05-12'
          expect(last_response.status).to eq(200)

      end

          expect(JSON.parse(last_response.body)).to eq({ "error" => "Invalid date format" })
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```
I'll add more routes and test cases so that I can practice more

- GET /expenses ‚Äì List all expenses (not just by date)
- GET /expense/:id
------------- These should added once we setup SQlite -------------
- DELETE /expenses/:id ‚Äì Delete a specific expense
- PUT /expenses/:id ‚Äì Update an existing expense
- GET /expenses/stats/:month ‚Äì Show monthly summary
- POST /budgets ‚Äì Set a budget limit for a category or month
- GET /categories
- GET /expenses?category=Food&date=2025-07-10 (this one needs `query params`, we're currently using `route params`)

In this chapter, we explored how to move from `acceptance tests` ‚Äî which ensure that the entire application works as a whole ‚Äî to `unit tests`, which isolate specific parts of the code, such as routing logic.

Unit tests typically run without a live server or real database, and instead focus on one class or method at a time. The benefits of this approach are faster test execution and clearer identification of where errors occur.

Rather than calling methods directly on the API class, we simulated HTTP requests using the `Rack::Test` interface. This aligns with the common testing principle of exercising a class through its public interface, which leads to better design decisions and a more user-focused API.

We also examined the `Ledger` class and introduced dependency injection (DI). In Ruby, this is as simple as passing an object as an argument to the constructor, like so:

```ruby
initialize(ledger: Ledger.new)
```
This technique makes it easier to swap in test doubles when testing, allowing us to isolate the API class from the actual persistence layer.

A test double is a generic term for objects that stand in for real ones during testing. Depending on the testing framework, they might be called mocks, stubs, fakes, or spies. In RSpec, we use the term double. Our goal was to create a fake Ledger object to test only the API logic ‚Äî without involving real data storage ‚Äî making the tests faster and more focused. `instance_double(class_to_fake)`

We also encountered verifying doubles, a powerful RSpec feature that ensures your test doubles reflect the real object‚Äôs interface. This helps avoid fragile tests. In our case, forgetting to instantiate the Ledger correctly caused RSpec to raise an error ‚Äî a valuable signal that our double wasn‚Äôt matching the actual interface.

If you ever need to inspect a full error stack trace during testing, you can run RSpec with the `--backtrace` or `-b` flag:

```ruby
bundle exec rspec -b
```

### Part II ‚Äî Chapter 6. Getting real. Integration specs. {#chapter-6}

Now we have a solid HTTP routing layer designed with the help of unit specs. These specs assummed that the underlying dependencies would eventually be implemented.

Now, it's time to write those dependecies for real.

Add the `sequel` and `sqlite` gems:

```ruby
bundle add sequel sqlite3
```
Remember we need to have 3 differents databases for testing, development and production so that we dont clobber with real data.

Then add the 3 files (2 for configurations and 1 for the expenses migration)
```ruby
# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/config/sequel.rb
require 'sequel'
DB = Sequel.sqlite("./db/#{ENV.fetch('RACK_ENV', 'development')}.db")

# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/spec/support/db.rb
# suite-level hook.
# The following code will make sure the database structure is set up and empty,
# ready for your specs to add data to it

RSpec.configure do |c|
  c.before(:suite) do 
    Sequel.extension :migration
    Sequel::Migrator.run(DB, 'db/migrations')
    DB[:expenses].truncate
  end
end

# 04-acceptance-specs/01/expense_tracker/db/migrations/0001_create_expenses.rb
Sequel.migration do
  change do
    create_table :expenses do
      primary_key :id
      String :payee
      Float :amount
      Date :date
    end
  end
end
```
Regarding the `before(:suite) hook` A typical hook will run before each example. This one will run just once: after all the specs have been loaded, but before the first one actually runs. That‚Äôs what before(:suite) hooks are for.

Then run the migration with `bundle exec sequel -m ./db/migrations sqlite://db/development.db --echo`

Outout you may see:

```ruby

2025-08-05 13:32:31 INFO: Finished applying migration version 1, direction: up, took 0.001072 seconds
```
Then we had to create a `spec/ledger_spec.rb` which will test out the `Ledger` class behavior.

```ruby
require_relative '../../../app/ledger'
require_relative '../../../config/sequel'
require_relative '../../support/db'

module ExpenseTracker
  RSpec.describe Ledger, :aggregate_failures do
    let(:ledger) { Ledger.new }
    let(:expense) do
      {
        'payee' => 'Starbucks',
        'amount' => 5.75,
        'date' => '2017-06-10'
      }
    end

    describe '#record' do
      context "with a valid expense" do
        it "succesfully saves the expense in the DB" do
          result = ledger.record(expense)

          expect(result).to be_success
          expect(DB[:expenses].all).to match [a_hash_including(
            id: result.expense_id,
            payee: 'Starbucks',
            amount: 5.75,
            date: Date.iso8601('2017-06-10')
          )]
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

And don't forget to add the logic into the `Ledger` class

```ruby
  def record(expense)
    DB[:expenses].insert(expense)
    id = DB[:expenses].max(:id)
    RecordResult.new(true, id, nil)
  end
```
Here we just leveraged 2 new matchers `be_success` and `match [a_hash_including]` This particular example we detoured a bit from TDD since we declared 2 `expects` under the same `it` block but we did it judiciously since every test that touches the DB is slower so if we follow rigorously one expect per test case we‚Äôre going to be repeating that setup and teardown many times.

Also, we did added the metada `:aggregate_failures` so that RSpec doesn't abort execution at the first error but to run all tests even with failures!

With this out of the way, let's add a test for invalid records

```ruby
  it "rejects the expense as invalid" do
    expense.delete('payee')

    result = ledger.record(expense)

    expect(result).not_to be_success
    expect(result.expense_id).to eq(nil)
    expect(result.error_message).to include('`payee` is required')

    expect(DB[:expenses].count).to eq(0)
  end
```
This will break our test, but that's all the purpose of the red-green-refactor cycle. Now let's add the valdiation for `Ledger class`

```ruby
class Ledger
  def record(expense)
    unless expense['payee']
      return RecordResult.new(false, nil, '`payee` is required')
    end

    DB[:expenses].insert(expense)
    id = DB[:expenses].max(:id)
    RecordResult.new(true, id, nil)
  end
end
```

Something important that authors mention is that everytime we run the test suite we are adding records to our db which is not good practice, therefore they suggest to add the next RSpec configuration for leeting RSpec that everytime it finds `:db` tag, it should perform a DB transaction which will entails seting up the DB before running the tests and wiping out after the test suite is ran.

```ruby
# suppor/db.rb
c.around(:example, :db) do |example|
  DB.transaction(rollback: :always) { example.run }
end
```

Here is a detailed list of steps that this script will do:

1. RSpec calls our `around hook`, passing it the example we‚Äôre running.
2. Inside the hook, we tell Sequel to start a new database transaction.
3. Sequel calls the inner block, in which we tell RSpec to run the example.
4. The body of the example finishes running.
5. Sequel rolls back the transaction, wiping out any changes we made to the database.
6. The around hook finishes, and RSpec moves on to the next example.

Now let's jump to implement the `GET /expenses_on(:date)` endpoint. First start with the test

```ruby
describe "#expenses_on" do
  it "returns all expenses for the date provided" do
    result_1 = ledger.record(expense.merge('date' => '2017-06-10'))
    result_2 = ledger.record(expense.merge('date' => '2017-06-10'))
    result_3 = ledger.record(expense.merge('date' => '2017-06-11'))

    expect(ledger.expenses_on('2017-06-10')).to contain_exactly(
      a_hash_including(id: result_1.expense_id),
      a_hash_including(id: result_2.expense_id)
    )
  end

  it "returns an empty array when there are no matching expenses" do
    expect(ledger.expenses_on('2017-06-10')). to eq([])
  end
end

# then the ruby logic

def expenses_on(date)
  DB[:expenses].where(date: date).all
end
```
This should pass all good!





Conclusion: while searching some other RSpec keywords i found this useful [RSpec cheat sheet from Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-driven-rails-resources/rspec.pdf) also we used the `:aggregate_failures` feature twice. This option allows the RSpec to continue running the entire test suite even when a test fails. We first applied it at the individual test case level, and then moved it up to an example group, which signaled RSpec to apply that behavior to the entire group.

We also introduced two new matchers: `be_success` and `match a_hash_including`.


Another key point we learned is that every spec interacting with the database will run more slowly. Because of this, we need to be judicious when applying the TDD methodology, which encourages writing one expect per test case. In some situations, we combined multiple expect statements within the same test case to speed up execution.

Finally, we explored the `--bisect` command, which is useful for identifying order-dependent tests. An order dependency occurs when a test fails only if another specific test runs before it. The `--bisect` command automatically isolates the minimal set of examples that cause the failure by repeatedly running subsets of your tests.

Example:

```ruby```
# First, run with a specific seed to reproduce the failure
rspec --seed 12345

# If you see a failure, run:
rspec --seed 12345 --bisect
```

Sample output:

```ruby
Bisect started using options: "--seed 12345"
Reducing test suite by half...
...
The minimal reproduction command is:
rspec ./spec/foo_spec.rb[1:3] ./spec/bar_spec.rb[1:5] --seed 12345
```
This tells you exactly which tests together trigger the failure, so you can debug the cause. It‚Äôs essentially automated detective work for the classic ‚Äúthis test only fails when that other one runs first‚Äù problem.

### Part III ‚Äî RSpec Core.

### Part III ‚Äî Chapter 7. Structuring code examples. {#chapter-7}

we've gained the mental model of "where things go" (either files or groups or examples or setup!)

we've have written short, clear examples that explain exactly what the expected behavior of the code is
laid examples into logical groups, not oly to share setup but foor keep related specs together

you'll learn how to organize specs into groups, you'll know where to put shared setup code and the trade-offs.

This will make the tests easier to read and maintain.

well-structures specs are about more than tidiness, sometimes you attach special behavior to certain examples or groups, like setting up a database or adding a custom error handling. the mechanism of metada (:tags) relies on good grouping.

Getting the words right.

Every RSpec is the example group in other testing Frameworks it is called test case class and it has multiple purposes:
- gives a logical structure for understanding how individual examples relate to one another
- describes the context such as a particular class, method or situation of what you are testing, 
- provides a ruby class to act as a scope for your shared logic, such as hooks let definition and helper methods, 
- runs, set up and tear down code shared by several examples.

The basic includes group examples, examples and expectations.

 `describe` creates an example group. This is the place where you put what you say you are testing, the description can be either a string a ruby class, a module or an object. when you use a class it has some advantages because it requires the class to exist and to be spelled correctly, Also you place here the tag filtering with extra information and that tag will be applied to the nested examples

 `it` creates a single example,  you pass a description of the behavior you are specifying as with describe you can also pass custom metadata to make it more specific remember that for bdd the crucial part is to ‚Äúgetting the words right‚Äù.

Now, so much alternatives for `describe` that makes more sense when the examples within that group all relate to a single class method or module that alternative is `context` which will make it more readable and considering that this is for the long term maintainability, and it will show the intent behind the code. 

another alternative is `example` instead of the `it` and it may be used when you are providing several data examples rather than several sentence about the subject or describing a behavior it will read much more clearly and lastly we have the specified instead of the it 

RSpec also provides the flexibility for adding the names you want in the book shows how you can combine this gem with `binding.pry`  and how you can add an alias to the `spec_helper.rb` file and use that in your Cascade or example and that will add the `pry: true`to metadata to its respective example group or single example and with this you can quickly toggle the pry behavior on and off just by adding or removing the name you define in the spec_helper.rb.

Sharing logic.

the main three organization tools are `let` definitions, `hooks`, and `helper methods` below is a code snippet that contains all of the three

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'POST a successful expense' do
  # let definitions
  let(:ledger) { instance_double('ExpenseTracker::Ledger') }
  let(:expense) { { 'some' => 'data' } }
  # hook
  before do
    allow(ledger).to receive(:record)
    .with(expense)
    .and_return(RecordResult.new(true, 417, nil))
  end
  # helper method
  def parsed_last_response
    JSON.parse(last_response.body)
  end
end
```

We have used the `let` definition several times in this book they are great for setting up anything that can be initialized in a line or two of code, and they give you the lazy evaluation for free which means that they are not going to be run until you actually invoke them.

 then we have the `hooks` that are for situations where they `let` definition block just won't cut it. the important thing about `hooks` is the one and how often you want the hook to run.

 Hooks.

"writing a hook involves two concepts. the type of hook controls <b>when it runs</b> relative to your examples. the scope controls <b>how often your hook runs.</b>‚Äù

For the when the hook should run we have three different types before, after, and around. as the name implies, you're before hook will run before your examples. after hooks guarantee to run after your examples, even if the example fails or did before hook races an example. this hooks are intended to clean up after your setup logic and specs. this style of hook is easy to read, but it does split the setup and tear down logic into two halves that we have to keep track of.

When your database cleanup logic doesn't fit neatly into a transactional around HOOK, we recommend using a before hook for the following reasons: 
if you forget to add the before hook to a particular spec the failure will happen in that example rather than a later one. 
when you run a single example to diagnose a failure the records will stick around in the database so that you can investigate them.

 the around hook it's a bit more complex because they sandwich your spec code inside your hook, so part of the hook runs before the example and part runs after. the behavior of these two Snippets is the same; it is just a question of which reads better for your application.

```ruby
RSpec.describe MyApp::Configuration do
  around(:example) do |ex|
    original_env = ENV.to_hash
    ex.run
    ENV.replace(original_env)
  end
end
```

Then we have the `config hooks` and this is if you need to run your hooks for multiple groups. you can define the hooks once for your entire Suite in the configuration typically `spec _ helper.rb`and they‚Äôll run for every example in your test suite

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.around(:example) do |ex|
    original_env = ENV.to_hash
    ex.run
    ENV.replace(original_env)
  end
end
```

 and with this they will run for every example in your test suite note the trade-off here:
 - Global hooks reduced duplication but can lead to surprising action at a distance effect in your aspects. 
 - hooks inside example groups are easier to follow but it is easy to leave out an important Hook by mistake when you are creating a new spec file.

 we do recommend only use config hooks for things that are not essential for understanding how your specs work. the Beats of logic  that isolate each example, such as a database transaction or environment sandboxing, or prime candidates.

 we prefer to keep things simple and run our hooks unconditionally. if, however, our config hooks are only needed by a subset of examples on particularly if they are as low, we will use metadata to make sure they run only for the subset that need them.

 now that we have seen when to run the hooks either before or after or around let's see the scope.

 this is meant when I hook needs to do a really timing tensive operation like creating a bunch of database tables or launching a live web server running the hook once per second will be cost provided. for this cases you can run the hook just once for the entire Suite of specs or once per example group. hooks take a symbol like `:suite` or `:context` argument to modify this code.

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'Web interface to my thermostat' do
  before(:context) do
    WebBrowser.launch
  end
  after(:context) do
    WebBrowser.shutdown
  end
end
```

 we only consider using context hook scope for side effects such as launching a web browser, that's satisfy both of the following two conditions: 

 does not interact with things that have a per example life cycle
 is noticeable slow to run

 when you use a context hook scope your responsible for cleaning up any resulting state otherwise, it can cause other specs to pass or fail incorrectly

 this is particularly common problem with database code. any records created in a before context hook scope will not run in your per example database transactions. the records will stick around after the example groups 

If you need to run a piece of setup call just once, before the first example begins that's what :suite

There may be some old syntax that you may find in code bases which is 
Old new
before(:each) became before(:example)
before(:all) became before(:suite)

Something important when a example group is nested the before hooks run from the outside in and the after hooks run from the inside out.

 <b>when to use hooks we have seen that hooks serve two different purposes: <b/>

removing duplicate it or incidental details that will distract readers from the point of your example.

 expressing the English descriptions of your example groups as executable code 

Abusing RSpec hooks will make you skip all over your spec directory to trace program flow.

Helper methods.

Sometimes, we can get too clever for our own good and misuse these constructs in an effort to remove every last bit of repetition from our specs. Let's see an example

```ruby
RSpec.describe BerlinTransitTicket do
  let(:ticket) { BerlinTransitTicket.new }

  before do
    # These values depend on `let` definitions
    # defined in the nested contexts below!
    #
    ticket.starting_station = starting_station
    ticket.ending_station = ending_station
  end

  let(:fare) { ticket.fare }

  context 'when starting in zone A' do
    let(:starting_station) { 'Bundestag' }

    context 'and ending in zone B' do
    let(:ending_station) { 'Leopoldplatz' }

    it 'costs ‚Ç¨2.70' do
      expect(fare).to eq 2.7
    end
  end

  context 'and ending in zone C' do
    let(:ending_station) { 'Birkenwerder' }

    it 'costs ‚Ç¨3.30' do
      expect(fare).to eq 3.3
    end
  end
end
```
With all these jumps around we have welcomed a behavior defined by the TDD community calls this separation of cause and effect a mystery guest [link](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/mystery-guest), now let's see how would be with a smart usage of `helpmer methods`

```ruby
RSpec.describe BerlinTransitTicket do
  def fare_for(starting_station, ending_station)
    ticket = BerlinTransitTicket.new
    ticket.starting_station = starting_station
    ticket.ending_station = ending_station
    ticket.fare
  end
  context 'when starting in zone A and ending in zone B' do
    it 'costs ‚Ç¨2.70' do
    expect(fare_for('Bundestag', 'Leopoldplatz')).to eq 2.7
    end
  end
  context 'when starting in zone A and ending in zone C' do
    it 'costs ‚Ç¨3.30' do
    expect(fare_for('Bundestag', 'Birkenwerder')).to eq 3.3
    end
  end
end
```
Now, it‚Äôs explicit exactly what behavior we‚Äôre testing, without our needing to repeat the details of the ticketing API. (these helper methods can be extracted into modules and be glued together by calling `include` into the group example)

Sharing examples groups

As we have seen, plain old Ruby modules work really nicely for sharing helper methods across example Scripts. but that's all they can share. if you want to reuse an example, a let construct or a hook, you will need to reach for another two; shared example groups.

 RS pack provides multiple ways to create and use shared sample grips. this come in paris, with one method for defining a Share Group and another for using it:

-shared_context and include_context are for reusing common setup and helper logic..
- shared_example and include_exampleAre for reusing examples..

 there is one more way to share behavior that is different, though. `it_behaves_like` creates a new, nested example to hold the shared code. the difference lies in how as isolated the shared behavior is from the rest of your examples.

Sharing context

Sooner or later, dough, you will find that you want to share some let declarations or hooks instead.

```ruby
before do
basic_authorize 'test_user', 'test_password'
end
```

This hook cannot go into your modules. plane will be modules are not aware of our aspect constructs such as hooks. instead, you can convert your module to a shared context:

```ruby
RSpec.shared_context 'API helpers' do
include Rack::Test::Methods
def app
ExpenseTracker::API.new
end
before do
basic_authorize 'test_user', 'test_password'
end
End
```

Here is how we use it:
```ruby
RSpec.describe 'Expense Tracker API', :db do
include_context 'API helpers'
# .
```

Remember that sharing context is for reusing common setup and helper logic.

Sharing examples.

One of the most powerful ideas in software is defining a single interface with multiple implementation for example your web app might need to cash data in a key Value Store there are many implementation of this idea each which its own advantages over the others let's see one example of these RS pack Behavior ‚Äúshared_example‚Äù

```ruby
require 'hash_kv_store'
RSpec.describe HashKVStore do
let(:kv_store) { HashKVStore.new }
it 'allows you to fetch previously stored values' do
kv_store.store(:language, 'Ruby')
kv_store.store(:os, 'linux')
expect(kv_store.fetch(:language)).to eq 'Ruby'
expect(kv_store.fetch(:os)).to eq 'linux'
end
it 'raises a KeyError when you fetch an unknown key' do
expect { kv_store.fetch(:foo) }.to raise_error(KeyError)
end
end
```
To test a second implementation of this interface such as a disk-backed `FileKVStore` ‚Äì you could copy and paste the entire spec and replace all occurrences of HashKVStore store with `FileKVStore`. but then you will have to add any new common Behavior to both specs files. we will have to manually keep it two specs files in sync.

This is exactly the kind of duplication that shared example groups can help you fix.  To make the switch, move your describe block into its own file and change it to a `shared_example` block taking an argument and use that argument in the `let(:kv_store)` declaration 

```ruby
RSpec.shared_examples 'KV store' do |kv_store_class|
‚û§ let(:kv_store) { kv_store_class.new }
it 'allows you to fetch previously stored values' do
kv_store.store(:language, 'Ruby')
kv_store.store(:os, 'linux')
expect(kv_store.fetch(:language)).to eq 'Ruby'
expect(kv_store.fetch(:os)).to eq 'linux'
end
it 'raises a KeyError when you fetch an unknown key' do
expect { kv_store.fetch(:foo) }.to raise_error(KeyError)
end
End
```

And we use it with the following code snippet:

```ruby
require 'hash_kv_store'
require 'support/kv_store_shared_examples'
RSpec.describe HashKVStore do
it_behaves_like 'KV store', HashKVStore
end
```

Nesting

In the introduction to this section, we mentioned that you can include shared
examples with either include_examples or it_behaves_like call. So far, we‚Äôve just used
It_behaves_like.

Calling include_examplesyou‚Äôd get two let declarations for :kv_store: one for HashKVStore and one for FileKVStore.

```ruby
$ rspec spec/include_examples_twice_spec.rb --format documentation
Key-value stores
allows you to fetch previously stored values
raises a KeyError when you fetch an unknown key
allows you to fetch previously stored values
raises a KeyError when you fetch an unknown key
Finished in 0.00355 seconds (files took 0.10257 seconds to load)
4 examples, 0 failures
```

Using it_behaves_like avoids this issue:

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'Key-value stores' do
it_behaves_like 'KV store', HashKVStore
it_behaves_like 'KV store', FileKVStore
End
```

This would output:

```ruby
$ rspec spec/it_behaves_like_twice_spec.rb --format documentation
Key-value stores
behaves like KV store
allows you to fetch previously stored values
raises a KeyError when you fetch an unknown key
behaves like KV store
allows you to fetch previously stored values
raises a KeyError when you fetch an unknown key
Finished in 0.00337 seconds (files took 0.09726 seconds to load)
4 examples, 0 failures
```

When in doubt, choose it behaves like

 it behaves like it's almost always the one you want. it ensures that the contents of the Share Group don't leak into the surrounding context and interact with your other examples.

 we recommend using include examples only when you are sure that shared example context on conflict with anything in the surrounding group.

### Part III ‚Äî Chapter 8. Slicing and dicing specs with metadata. {#chapter-8}

Slicing and Dicing specs with Metadata

In this chapter we are going to learn what type of information are spec stores for each example that it is run how to add more information to that previous stack coma and how to read it, how to perform expensive setup only when we need it and how to run just a subset of tests.

 over the course of this book, we have far away cute principle that has made our specs faster, more reliable, and easier to use: ‚Äú run just the code you need.‚Äù
 when you are isolating a failure, run just the feeling example.
 when you are modifying a class, run just it's unit tests.
 when you've got expensive setup code, only run it for the specs where you need it.

 a key piece of RS pack that's made many of these practices possible is its powerful metadata system. metadata undergirds many of our aspects features, and rs back exposes the same system for your use.

Defining metadata

 where do I keep information about the context my specs are running in? by contact, we mean things like:
 example configuration open parentheses for example, Mark as escaped or pending close parentheses
 source code locations
 status of the previous run
 how one example runs differently than others for example needing a web browser or a DB

 without some way of attaching data to examples, you and the are aspect maintainers will be stock juggling Global variables and writing a bunch of bookkeeping code..

RSpec solution to this problem couldn't beSimpler:  a plain Ruby hash. every example an example group gets its own such hash, known as the metadata hash.RSpec  populates this hash with any metadata you have explicitly chat the example with, plus some useful entries of its own.

If you create the following file and you run the test you will see the next information on your terminal:

```ruby
require 'pp'
RSpec.describe Hash do
it 'is used by RSpec for metadata' do |example|
pp example.metadata
end
end

# this w ould be the output

$ rspec spec/metadata_spec.rb
{:block=>
#<Proc:0x007fa6fc07e6a8@~/code/metadata/spec/metadata_spec.rb:4>,

:last_run_status=>"unknown"}
.
Finished in 0.00279 seconds (files took 0.09431 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

Listen if it shows something that we haven't talked about before: getting access to your examples properties at the wrong time. you can  so by having your eight block take an argument. it will pass an object representing the currently running example.

 the call to example that metadata returns a hash containing all the metadata.  kiss like description just the string we passed to it, full description includes the checks passed to the describe, describe class, fire path, example groups and last round status with four different values as past, pending, failed or unknown

Custom metadata

 if we want to add extra metadata to our examples in order to identify it better or to one our colleagues we can do it with the next procedure:

```ruby
require 'pp'
RSpec.describe Hash do
‚û§ it 'is used by RSpec for metadata', :fast do |example|
pp example.metadata
end
end

# this will save`:fast=>true`, we can also add more than one, for example :fast, :focus 
```

Then we can call those example that contain the :fast meta tag with `$ rspec --tag fast`

We can also do it for all examples by adding it to `spec_helper.rb`

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
config.define_derived_metadata(file_path: /spec\/unit/) do |meta|
meta[:fast] = true
end
end
```

Default metadata

As we saw previously with the tag `:aggreagate_failures`Which will run all the test even when they fail, we can add these two all of the examples again adding it to the RSpec.configure

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
config.define_derived_metadata do |meta|
# Sets the flag unconditionally;
# doesn't allow examples to opt out
meta[:aggregate_failures] = true
end
end
```
Here is something important that if we don't want to use that metal type the next code will be overwritten by the global setting: 

```ruby
RSpec.describe 'Billing', aggregate_failures: false do
context 'using the fake payment service' do
before do
expect(MyApp.config.payment_gateway).to include('sandbox')
end
# ...
end
end
```

Therefore we need to tweak it a little bit in order to allow the example group to follow its own rules we need to add a conditional to the spec helper 

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
config.define_derived_metadata do |meta|
meta[:aggregate_failures] = true unless meta.key?(:aggregate_failures)
end
end
```

I say recap of this chapter we can conclude that it will be hash is created every time we run our test Suite and wouldn't that hash we can find configurations, where the code is located, status of the example, we can even add our own tags And we can print that hash at the wrong time with `.metadata`

Selecting which specs to run

When you are running your specs, you often want to change which ones you include. in this section we are going to show you a few different situations where this kind of slicing and dicing comes in handy.

 most of the time when we start writing our tests, we don't run then Tire so. we are either running unit spec for a specific class we are designing or we are kicking off some integration specs to catch regressions.

 one example to exclude some examples is the following tag:

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
config.filter_run_excluding :jruby_only unless RUBY_PLATFORM == 'java'
end
```

The `filter_run_excluding` call indicates which examples we‚Äôre leaving out. The flip side to that method is filter_run_including, or just filter_run for short.

This style of filtering is pretty brute-force. If no examples match the filter, RSpec will run nothing at all.
A more generally useful approach is to use filter_run_when_matching. With this method, if nothing matches the filter, RSpec just ignores it.

Remember that `RSpec.configure` block are permanent settings, baked into your setup code. They‚Äôll be in effect every time you run RSpec.

If you want to run your specific subset of tests from command line you can do it with the following
```ruby
$ rspec --tag fast # this will run just the examples tagged with :fast 

# this will do exactly the opposite, run all except the tests tagged with :fast
$ rspec --tag ~fast
```

Sharing code conditionally

 we discussed three ways to share code across many examples groups:
 top level config hooks
 modules containing helper methods
 shared context containingRSpec constructs such as Hooks and let blocks

Metadata is what enables this flexibility, and you can use it with all the culture and techniques we listed earlier:

Config hooks. pass a filter expression as a second argument to config.before, config.after or config.aroundTo run that hook only for example matching the filter.
```ruby
# spec/spec_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before(:example, :db) do
    puts "Setting up database for this example..."
  end

  config.after(:example, slow: true) do
    puts "Cleaning up after a slow example..."
  end

  config.around(:example, api: true) do |example|
    puts "Before API example"
    example.run
    puts "After API example"
  end
end

# Usage in a spec:
RSpec.describe "Some feature" do
  it "needs database setup", :db do
    # ...
  end

  it "is a slow example", slow: true do
    # ...
  end

  it "calls the API", api: true do
    # ...
  end
end
```
 modules. at the filter expression to the end of your config that include call in order to include a module and it's helper methods conditionally. this also works for similar `config.extend` and `config.prepend`

 ```ruby
 # spec/support/api_helpers.rb
module APIHelpers
  def api_call(path)
    # pretend API call here
  end
end

# spec/spec_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include APIHelpers, api: true
end

# Usage:
RSpec.describe "API requests", :api do
  it "can call the API" do
    api_call("/status")
  end
end
```

 shared context. just ask with modules, at a filter expression  when calling config.include_contest.  this will bring in your shirt let constructs among other things into just example groups you want.

 ```ruby
 # spec/support/api_context.rb
RSpec.shared_context "API context" do
  let(:auth_token) { "secret" }
end

# spec/spec_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include_context "API context", api: true
end

# Usage:
RSpec.describe "Authenticated API request", :api do
  it "uses the auth token" do
    expect(auth_token).to eq "secret"
  end
end
```

Here are some other examples of metadata that we have seen before

### Part III ‚Äî Chapter 9. Configuring RSpec. {#chapter-9}

As you have work through there exercises in this book, you have often change RS specs Behavior to make it a better tool for your needs here are just a few of the things that you have customized:

 set up until you're down a test database, but only for the examples that require one
 report every failing expectation in an example not just the first one
 run just examples that you are focusing on at the moment
 

you can configure rspec into basic ways:
 on rspec.configure block:  provides access to all configuration options: since the block lives in your code, you will typically use it to make permanent changes
 command line options: provides access to some configurations options, typically one off settings

Command line configurations

 to see all available command line options, run `rspec  ‚Äìhelp` and you'll see in you terminal options for:
 - calling, loading files or directories
 - tweak the output (formatting, write output in a file, backtrace, color, no color)
 - filtering/tags, (match a word, only run a specific example, all failures, next failure)
 - Utility (Initialize your project with RSpec, run RSpec version)

R s p e c already asked the two most important directories to load path your projects leave and expect folders.

 we have filtering options like the following

 we have output options like the following

 and if you want to save this options to customize the behavior for everyone we have three different options

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File</th>
      <th>Usage</th>
      <th>Gotcha</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>~/.rspec</td>
      <td>Stores global personal RSpec preferences for all projects on your machine.</td>
      <td>Affects every project; avoid settings that could break others‚Äô test runs if shared.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>./.rspec</td>
      <td>Project-level defaults; should contain only essential settings agreed upon by the team.</td>
      <td>Overusing for personal prefs can cause conflicts; always commit only team-approved settings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>./.rspec-local</td>
      <td>Per-project personal preferences; lives alongside the project‚Äôs <code>.rspec</code> file.</td>
      <td>Exclude from version control; every developer may have their own version.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

 something to keep in mind is that the order that we have listed above is how options take precedence, local options will override more global ones. For instance, if your project has `--profile 5` set in its `.rspec` file, you could override this setting by putting `--no-profile` in the project‚Äôs .`rspec-local` file.

Using a custom formatter

 a question for matter is a regular Ruby class that registers itself with rspec to receive notification.  as your suite runs, rspec notifies the formatter of the events it is subscribed to, such as starting an example group, running an example, or encountering a failure.

R s p e c s built in formatters display failure details, messages and back traces, at the very end of the run. however, as you suite grows and start thinking longer to complete, it can be nice to see failure details as soon as they are cure.
How far matters work.

 a formatter goes through three main steps:
 register itself with rspec to receive a specific notifications
 initialize itself at the beginning of the rsvc Run
 react to events as they occur

RSpec.configure

We have seen how easily we can set configuration options for a particular spec run via the command line. as convenient as they are this modifications are not available for all the test suit. for the rest will need to call RS p e c. configure inside one or more Ruby files. you can have multiple configure blocks in your code base; if you do rspec will combine the options from all of them.

Cuz we have seen before a hook can run for each example, once for each context, or globally for the entire suit .

We also have other special purpose configuration hook that doesn't fit the typical before, after, around pattern. and example would be

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
config.when_first_matching_example_defined(:db) do
require 'support/db'
end
end
```

This hook uses metadata :db  to perform extra configuration just for the specs that needed.

 while config hooks are great way to reduce duplication and keep your example focused, there are significant downsides if you overuse them:
 it's low test suit due to extra logic running for every example
 spec star hotter to understand because their logic is hidden in hooks
 to avoid this pitfalls you can use a simpler, more explicit technique: using Ruby modules inside your configure blocks.

Sharing code with Ruby modules 

```ruby
# spec_configure.rb
class Performer
include Singing # won't override Performer methods
prepend Dancing # may override Performer methods
end
```
You can even bring methods into an individual object:
```ruby
# spec_configure.rb
average_person = AveragePerson.new 
average_person.extend Singing
```

RSpec provides the same kind of interface inside RSpec.configure blocks. By calling include, prepend, or extend on the config object

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
# Brings methods into each example
config.include ExtraExampleMethods
# Brings methods into each example,
# overriding methods with the same name
# (rarely used)
config.prepend ImportantExampleMethods
# Brings methods into each group (alongside let/describe/etc.)
# Useful for adding to RSpec's domain-specific language
config.extend ExtraGroupMethods
end
```
These three config methods are great for sharing Ruby methods across the respects. if you need to share more, though such as hooks or let definitions, you will need to define a shirt example group.

```ruby
# spec_configure.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
config.include_context 'My Shared Group'
end
``` 
Filtering

 we have found the need to run just some of the examples in your suit therefore we have used rsps filtering to run the following subsets of specs:
 a single example or group by name
 only the specs matching a certain piece of metadata such as :fast 

Some of the rspec configuration system that we have used inside of our configure block are the following

```ruby
RSpec.configure do |config|
 config.filter_run_when_matching :focus # Runs only examples/groups tagged with :focus
  config.example_status_persistence_file_path = 'spec/examples.txt' # Stores example run status for --only-failures/--next-failure
  config.filter_gems_from_backtrace 'rack', 'rack-test', 'sequel', 'sinatra' # Removes listed gems from failure backtraces
  config.filter_run_when_matching :focus # Duplicate line; same as first setting above
end
```
And if I was reviewing the directory of the exercises from Facebook are realized that the configure block is almost everywhere either from the root directory to a specific model specs files where we need it a more granually effect on the test running

As a conclusion for this chapter we have explored that we have two ways to configure the rspec testing framework one is from the command line and the other is with the configure method. command line options are easy to discover and they are one off to modify the next output the next format or to run a subset of tests on the other hand with configure method covers the whole test suit and also we can have more control as we declare those configure blocks inside of the files 

### Part IV ‚Äî RSpec expectations.

With rspec-expectations, you can easily express expected outcomes about your code. It uses simple matcher objects that can be composed in useful, powerful ways. 

We‚Äôll dig into how rspec-expectations works, how to compose matchers, and why doing so is useful.

### Part IV ‚Äî Chapter 10. Exploring RSpec expectations. {#chapter-10}

In RSpec Core, we saw how rspec-core helps you structure your test code into example groups and examples. but having a sound structure is not enough for writing good tests. If our specs run code without looking at the output, we are not really testing anything, except the code doesn't crash outright. That's where RSpec-expectations comes in. it provides an API for a specifying expected outcomes.

RSpec example should contain one or more expectations. This express what you expect to be true at a specific point in your code.

In this chapter, we'll see how one crucial part of expectations ‚Äì the matcher can be combined in useful new ways.

```ruby
ratio = 22 / 7.0
expect(ratio).to be_within(0.1).of(Math::PI)

numbers = [13, 3, 99]
expect(numbers).to all be_odd

alphabet = ('a'..'z').to_a
expect(alphabet).to start_with('a').and end_with('z')
```

The primary goal of `rspec-expectations` is clarity, both in the examples you write and in the output when something goes wrong.

Parts of an expectation:

```ruby
expect(deck.cards.count).to eq(52), 'not playing with a full deck'
```
While there is some variety here, the syntax consistently uses just a few example parts:
 - A subject - the thing you are testing, that is, an instance of a Ruby class.
 - A matcher - an object that specifies what you expect to be true about the subject, and provides the past or fail logic
 - (Optionally) a custom failure message

</div>

irb session

```ruby
irb(main):001> require 'rspec/expectations'
=> true
irb(main):002> include RSpec::Matchers
=> Object
irb(main):003> expect(1).to eq(1)
=> true
irb(main):004> expect(1).to eq(2)
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-support-3.13.4/lib/rspec/support.rb:110:in 'block in <module:Support>':  (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
expected: 2
     got: 1
(compared using ==)
```

Wrapping your subject with expect

Ruby begins evaluating your expectation at the `expect` method. 

Let‚Äôs go to irb session again:

```ruby
irb(main):005> expect_one = expect(1)
=> 
#<RSpec::Expectations::ValueExpectationTarget:0x000000013ad9...
irb(main):006> expect_one
=> 
#<RSpec::Expectations::ValueExpectationTarget:0x000000013ad99708
 @target=1>
```

Here, our subject is the number 1. We have wrapped in the `expect` method to give ourself a place to attach methods like `to` or `not_to`. in other words the `expect` methods wraps are object in a test friendly adapter. 

Side note: prior versions of RSpec expect method what `should` and `should_not` respectively.

Using a matcher

If `expect` wraps your object for testing, then the `matcher` actually performs the test. The matcher checks that the subject satisfies its criteria. `matcher` can compare numbers, find patterns in text, examine deeply nested data structures or perform any custom Behavior you need.

The `RSpec::Matchers` module ships with built-in methods to create matchers:

```ruby
irb(main):007> be_one = eq(1)
=> 
#<RSpec::Matchers::BuiltIn::Eq:0x000000013abf9808
...
irb(main):008> be_one
=> 
#<RSpec::Matchers::BuiltIn::Eq:0x000000013abf9808
 @expected=1>
```
This `matcher` can‚Äôt do anything on its own; we still need to combine it with the `subject` we saw in the previous section.

Please, notice how `expect(1)` built an `ExpectationTarget` object internally returns:

`@target` ‚Üí is the actual value you passed in (1 in our example).

This object is just a holder for that value, plus some helper methods like `.to` and `.not_to`

Then, with `eq(1)` built a matcher object (in this case `RSpec::Matchers::BuiltIn::Eq`).

And internally `@expected` ‚Üí is the value you want to match against (1 here).

```ruby
irb(main):011> expect_one.to(be_one)
=> true
irb(main):012> expect_one.not_to(be_one)
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-support-3.13.4/lib/rspec/support.rb:110:in 'block in <module:Support>':  (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
expected: value != 1
     got: 1

(compared using ==)
```
The `to` method tries to match the subject (in this case, the integer 1) against the provided matcher. If there‚Äôs a match, the method returns `true`; if not, it bails with a detailed `failure message`.

The `not_to` method does the opposite:

```ruby
irb(main):017> expect_one.not_to eq(be_one)
=> true
irb(main):014> expect(1).not_to eq(2)
=> true
```

When you think of RSpec expectations as being just a couple of simple Ruby objects glued together, the syntax becomes clear. You‚Äôll use parentheses with the `expect` method call, a dot to attach the `to` or `not_to` method, and a space leading up to the `matcher` (maybe `eq`).

Custom failure messages.

Let's see an example of a very brief Ruby code that will show us a technically correct error however we can make it more explicit by adding an alternate failure message along to the matcher `to` or `not_to`

```ruby
irb(main):018> resp = Struct.new(:status, :body).new(400, 'unknown query param `sort`')
=> #<struct  status=400, body="unknown query param `sort`">
irb(main):019> expect(resp.status).to eq(200)
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-support-3.13.4/lib/rspec/support.rb:110:in 'block in <module:Support>':  (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
expected: 200
     got: 400

(compared using ==)

irb(main):020> expect(resp.status).to eq(200), "Got a #{resp.status}: #{resp.body}"
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-support-3.13.4/lib/rspec/support.rb:110:in 'block in <module:Support>': Got a 400: unknown query param `sort` (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
```

When the matchers default failure message doesn't provide enough detail, a custom message maybe just what you need. You can save time by writing your own matches instead if you find yourself using the same message repeatedly.

How matchers work

Any Ruby object can be used as a matcher as long as it implements a minimal set of methods (`.matches?` and `.failure_message`), let‚Äôs build one in irb

```ruby
irb(main):021> matcher = Object.new
=> #<Object:0x0000000138954280>
irb(main):022> expect(1).to matcher
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-expectations-3.13.5/lib/rspec/matchers.rb:968:in 'RSpec::Matchers#method_missing': undefined method 'matches?' for #<Object:0x0000000138954280> (NoMethodError)
Did you mean?  match
```
This expectation has triggered a NoMethodError exception. RSpec expects every matcher to implement a `matches?` method, which takes an object and returns `true` if the object matches (and `false` otherwise).

```ruby
irb(main):027* def matcher.matches?(actual)
irb(main):028*   actual == 1
irb(main):029> end
=> :matches?
irb(main):030> expect(1).to matcher
=> true
```

When the match fails, RSpec expectations calls the matcher‚Äôs failure_message method

```ruby
irb(main):031> expect(2).to matcher
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-expectations-3.13.5/lib/rspec/matchers.rb:968:in 'RSpec::Matchers#method_missing': undefined method 'failure_message' for #<Object:0x0000000138954280> (NoMethodError)
# here we implemented the .failure_message
irb(main):035* def matcher.failure_message
irb(main):036*   'expected object to equal 1'
irb(main):037> end
=> :failure_message
irb(main):038> expect(2).to matcher
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-support-3.13.4/lib/rspec/support.rb:110:in 'block in <module:Support>': expected object to equal 1 (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
```
These two methods `matches?` and `failure_message`  are all you need to define a simple matcher.

<div style="text-align: center;">Composing matchers</div>

Where the matchers really shine is when you compose them with other matchers to specify exactly what you expect and nothing more. the result is more robust tests and fewer false failures. Here are a few different ways to compose matchers:

    <tr>
      <th>Technique</th>

      <th>Code example</th>
    </tr>

      <td><code>expect(score).to be &gt; 5 &amp; be &lt; 10</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


How matchers match objects

Matchers build on top of Ruby's standard protocols in order to provide composability: the humble === method. This method, often called ‚Äúthree equals‚Äù or ‚Äúcase equality‚Äù defines a category to which other objects may or may not be long. most of the time you wont call it directly from production code. Instead, Ruby will call it for you inside each one class of a case expression 

```ruby
irb(main):039* def describe_value(value)
irb(main):040*   case value
irb(main):041*   when be_within(0.1).of(Math::PI) then 'Pi'
irb(main):042*   when be_within(0.1).of(2 * Math::PI) then 'Double Pi'
irb(main):043*   end
irb(main):044> end
=> :describe_value
irb(main):045> describe_value(3.14159)
=> "Pi"
irb(main):046> describe_value(6.28319)
=> "Double Pi"
```
RSpec expectations perform the same check internally that Ruby's case statement does: they call === on the object you pass in. that object can be anything, including another matcher.

Passing one matcher into another

It may not be obvious why you would need to pass a matcher to another matcher. that say you expect a particular array to start with a value that's near pi. with rspec, you can pass the `be_within(0.1).of(Math::PI)` matcher matcher into the `start_with`

```ruby
irb(main):047> numbers = [3.14159, 1.734, 4.273]
=> [3.14159, 1.734, 4.273]
irb(main):048> expect(numbers).to start_with( be_within(0.1).of(Math::PI) )
=> true

irb(main):049> expect([]).to start_with( a_value_within(0.1).of(Math::PI) )
/Users/dominiclizarraga/.rbenv/versions/3.4.2/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/gems/rspec-support-3.13.4/lib/rspec/support.rb:110:in 'block in <module:Support>': expected [] to start with a value within 0.1 of 3.141592653589793
```
Embedding matches in Array and hash data structures

This ability to compose matchers‚Äîby passing them into one another, or by embedding them in data structures‚Äîlets you be as precise or as vague as you need to be.

In other matchers like `match_array` or `contain_exactly`, RSpec does recursively apply matchers inside arrays and hashes, but start_with (and end_with) do not.

```ruby
irb(main):069* presidents = [
irb(main):070* { name: 'George Washington', birth_year: 1732 },
irb(main):071* { name: 'John Adams', birth_year: 1735 },
irb(main):072* { name: 'Thomas Jefferson', birth_year: 1743 },
irb(main):073* # ...
irb(main):074> ]
=> 
[{name: "George Washington", birth_year: 1732},
...
irb(main):075* expect(presidents).to start_with(
irb(main):076*   match(name: 'George Washington', birth_year: a_value_between(1730, 1740)),
irb(main):077*   match(name: 'John Adams', birth_year: a_value_between(1730, 1740))
irb(main):078> )
=> true
```

Combining matters with logical and or operators

There‚Äôs another way to combine matchers: compound matcher expressions. Every built-in matcher has two methods (`and` and `or`).

```ruby
irb(main):079> alphabet = ('a'..'z').to_a
irb(main):080> 
=> 
["a",
...
irb(main):081> expect(alphabet).to start_with('a').and end_with('z')
irb(main):082> 
=> true
irb(main):083> stoplight_color = %w[ green red yellow ].sample
irb(main):084> 
=> "yellow"
irb(main):085> expect(stoplight_color).to eq('green').or eq('red').or eq('yellow')
irb(main):086> 
=> true
```

You can use the words `and/or`, or you can use the `&` and `|` operators

Generated example descriptions

Matchers have another useful ability over simpler assert methods: they‚Äôre selfdescribing.

```ruby
irb(main):087> start_with(1).description
=> "start with 1"
irb(main):088> (start_with(1) & end_with(9)).description
=> "start with 1 and end with 9"
irb(main):089> contain_exactly( a_string_starting_with(1) & ending_with(9) ).description
=> "contain exactly (a string starting with 1 and ending with 9)"
```
As you can see, the descriptions of composed and compound matchers include the description of each part.

### Part IV ‚Äî Chapter 11. Matchers included in RSpec expectations. {#chapter-11}

In the previous chapter, we learned how to write expectations to check your codes behavior. We got to know the various parts of an expectation like a subject and the matcher.

Now, it's time to take a closer look at matchers. You have called them in your specs and combine them with other matchers.  RSpec ships with a ton of useful matchers to help you specify exactly how you want the code to behave.

The matchers in RSpec expectations fall into three growth categories:

- Primitive: matchers for basic data types like strings, numbers and so on
- High order matchers: that can take other matchers as inputs, then apply them across collections
- Block matchers: for checking properties of code including blocks, exceptions, and side effects.
 
Primitive matches
 
The word primitive in a programming language refers to a breath and butter data type that cannot be broken down into a smaller pieces. booleans, integers, and floating point numbers are all primitives.

Primitive matchers are similar. They have simple, precise definitions that cannot be broken down any further. They are not meant to accept other matchers as input (but you can go the other direction, passing them into other matchers). Typically, they just pass the operation you are performing - and equality check, for example a straight through the subject of the expectation.

Equality and identity
 
Most fundamentals matchers are all concerned with variations of the question: ‚Äúare these two things the same?‚Äù,  depending on the context. "The same" might refer to one of the several things:

- <span style="color: orange;">Identity:</span> for example, two references to one object

- <span style="color: green;">Hash key equality:</span> two objects of the same type and value, such as two copies of the string ‚Äúhello‚Äù.

- <span style="color: blue;">Value equality:</span> two objects of compatible types with the same meaning, such as the integer 42 on the floating Point number 42.0

<span style="color: blue;">Value equality</span>

Most of the time, Ruby programmers are concerned with the last of these: <b>value equality</b>, embodied in Ruby's === operator.

This matcher is the one you want. However, sometimes you have a more specific me. 

```ruby
expect(Math.sqrt(9)).to eq(3)
# equivalent to:
Math.sqrt(9) == 3
```

<span style="color: orange;">Identity</span>

```ruby
perms = Permutations.new
first_try = perms.of(long_word_list)
second_try = perms.of(long_word_list)
expect(second_try).to eq(first_try)
```

This test will likely give you a false assurances. If the underlying cache is misbehaving or was never implemented, the calculation will just run again and produce a new word list in the same order. Because both arrays have the same contents, your test will incorrectly pass.

<b>Instead, you would like to know whether or not `first_try` and `second_try` are actually referring to the same underlaying object, not just two copies with identical contents.</b>

For this stricter comparison, you will use `equal` matcher, which hands off to Ruby's `equal?` method behind the scenes:

```ruby
expect(second_try).to equal(first_try)
```

If you prefer you can also use `be(x)` as an alias for `equal(x)` to emphasize that this matcher is about <b>identity rather than value equality</b>

```ruby
expect(RSpec.configuration).to be(RSpec.configuration)
```

<span style="color: green;">Hash key equality</span>

Programmers rarely check hash key equality directly. As the name implies, it's used to check that two values should be considered the same Hash key.

RSpec `eql` matcher, based on Ruby's built-in `eql?` method, checks for hash key equality. Generally, it behaves the same as the `eq` matcher since `eql?` always considers integers and floating point numbers to be different.

```ruby
# 3 == 3.0:
expect(3).to eq(3.0)
# ...but 3.eql?(3.0) is false:
expect(3).not_to eql(3.0)
```

This behavior allows 3 and 3.0 to be used as different keys in the same hash.

  When in doubt, try `eq` first. (In most situations, value equality is the one you need.)
</div>


Variations

All three of these matchers have aliases that read better in composed matcher expressions:

- <span style="color: blue;">`an_object_eq_to` aliases `eq`</span> (identity)
- <span style="color: orange;">`an_object_equal_to` aliases `equal`</span> (value equality)
- <span style="color: green;">`an_object_eql_to` aliases `eql`</span> (hash key equality)

For instance, consider the following expectation that checks a list of Ruby classes:

```ruby
expect([String, Regexp]).to include(String)
```

The intent was to require the actual Ruby String class to be present. Higher-order matchers like `include` check
their arguments with the three-quals operator, ===. In this case, RSpec ends up checking String === 'a string', which returns true.

The fix is to pass the `an_object_eq_to`

```ruby
expect([String, Regexp]).to include(an_object_eq_to String)
```

Truthiness

While Ruby has literal `true` and `false` values, it allows any object to be used in a conditional. The rules are very simple `false` and `nil` are both treated as `false`, and everything else is treated as `true` even the numbers 0.

```ruby
expect(true).to be_truthy
expect(0).to be_truthy
expect(false).not_to be_truthy
expect(nil).not_to be_truthy
# ...and on the flip side:
expect(false).to be_falsey
expect(nil).to be_falsey
expect(true).not_to be_falsey
expect(0).not_to be_falsey
```

If you want to specify that the value is precisely equal to `true` or `false`, simply use one of the equality matchers we described in the last section:

```ruby
expect(1.odd?).to be true
expect(2.odd?).to eq false
```

Alises:

‚Ä¢ `be_truthy` is aliased as `a_truthy_value`.
‚Ä¢ `be_falsey` is aliased as `be_falsy`, `a_falsey_value` and `a_falsy_value`.

Operator comparisons

We have used the`be` method with arguments before, as in `expect(answer).to be(42).` This method has another form, one without arguments. with it you can perform greater-than and less-than comparisons:

```ruby
expect(1).to be == 1
expect(1).to be < 2
expect(1).to be <= 2
expect(2).to be > 1
expect(2).to be >= 1
expect(String).to be === 'a string'
expect(/foo/).to be =~ 'food'
```

In each case, RSpec uses your operator such as `==` or `<` to compare the actual and the matcher on the first line, be == 1, is equivalent to `eq(1)`.

Delta and range comparisons 

Checking two floats for exact equality will frequently cause failures

```ruby
expect(0.1 + 0.2).to eq(0.3)
‚Ä¶then you get a failure:
expected: 0.3
got: 0.30000000000000004
(compared using ==)
```

Absolute difference

Instead of looking for exact equality with floats, you should use `be_within` matcher:

```ruby
expect(0.1 + 0.2).to be_within(0.0001).of(0.3)
```

Relative difference

Equally useful is the `percent_of` method, where you give a relative difference instead:

```ruby 
town_population = 1237
expect(town_population).to be_within(25).percent_of(1000)
```

A single `be_within` matcher supports both absolute and relative values, based on which method you chain off of it

Ranges

Sometimes, it‚Äôs a better fit to express your expected values in terms of a range, rather than a target value and delta.

```ruby
expect(town_population).to be_between(750, 1250)
```
` be_within` is aliased to `a_value_within` and `be_between` is aliased to `a_value_between`

Dynamic predicates

A predicate is a method that answers a question with a Boolean answer. For example, Ruby‚Äôs Array class provides an empty? method rather than is_empty.

```ruby
expect([]).to be_empty
```

You can alternately use a `be_a_` or `be_an_` prefix for predicates that are nouns.

```ruby
expect(user).to be_admin
expect(user).to be_an_admin

hash = { name: 'Harry Potter', age: 17, house: 'Gryffindor' }
expect(hash).to have_key(:age)
```
How Dynamic Predicate Matchers Work

1. You write: `expect(user).to be_admin`
2. RSpec sees: "Hmm, I don't recognize `be_admin`, but it follows the pattern `be_*`"
3. RSpec transforms it: Strips off `be_`, adds `?`, and calls that method on the subject
4. RSpec actually calls: `user.admin?`

```ruby
# What you write          ‚Üí  What RSpec calls
expect(user).to be_admin    ‚Üí  user.admin?
expect([]).to be_empty      ‚Üí  [].empty?
expect(str).to be_blank     ‚Üí  str.blank?
expect(obj).to be_valid     ‚Üí  obj.valid?
```

Trade-offs

As readable and useful as Dynamic predicate math chairs can be, they do have some trade-offs. For example if you want to test for exact true or false results and another bigger problem is documentation, because Dynamic matters are generated on the fly, they have no documentation. 

Higher-order matchers 

All the matchers seen so far are primitives. Now, we are going to look at higher order matchers that is, matchers that you can pass other matchers into. With this technique, you can build up composed matchers that specify exactly the behavior you need.

 Collections and strings

 RSpec ships with six different matches for dealing with data structures:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Matcher</th>
      <th>Usage</th>
      <th>Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>include</td>
      <td>Checks that certain items are present (any order).</td>
      <td><code>expect([1, 2, 3]).to include(2, 3)</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>start_with</td>
      <td>Checks that items appear at the beginning.</td>
      <td><code>expect([1, 2, 3]).to start_with(1, 2)</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>end_with</td>
      <td>Checks that items appear at the end.</td>
      <td><code>expect("foobar").to end_with("bar")</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>all</td>
      <td>Checks that all elements satisfy a matcher.</td>
      <td><code>expect([1, 3, 5]).to all be_odd</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>match</td>
      <td>Matches a data structure exactly (order matters for arrays).</td>
      <td><code>expect([1, 2]).to match([be_odd, be_even])</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>contain_exactly</td>
      <td>Checks that a collection has exactly these items (order doesn't matter).</td>
      <td><code>expect([1, 2, 3]).to contain_exactly(3, 2, 1)</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


All of these matchers also work with strings, with a few minor differences.

Include

The `include` matcher is one of the most flexible.  By using `include` rather than a structure matcher like `eq` or `match`, you can specify just the elements you care about. The collection can contain unrelated items, and your test will still pass.

At its simplest, the `include` matcher works on any object with an `include?` method. Strings and arrays both support this method.

```ruby
expect('a string').to include('str')
expect([1, 2, 3]).to include(3)

hash = { name: 'Harry Potter', age: 17, house: 'Gryffindor' }
expect(hash).to include(:name)
expect(hash).to include(age: 17)
```

It also accepts a variable number of arguments so that you can specify multiple substrings, array items, hash keys or key-value pairs:

```ruby
expect('a string').to include('str', 'ing')
expect([1, 2, 3]).to include(3, 2)

expect(hash).to include(:name, :age)
expect(hash).to include(name: 'Harry Potter', age: 17)
```

This works well, but there is a gotcha related to variable numbers of items. Consider this example:

```ruby
expecteds = [3, 2]
expect([1, 2, 3]).to include(expecteds)

# failure message
expected [1, 2, 3] to include [3, 2]

# possible solutions:

expect([1, [3, 2]]).to include([3, 2])
expect([1, 2, 3]).to include(*expecteds)
```

`start_with` and `end_with`

These two matchers are useful when you care about the content of a string or a collection at the start or end but don't care about the rest.

```ruby
expect('a string').to start_with('a str').and end_with('ng')
expect([1, 2, 3]).to start_with(1).and end_with(3)

# use separately 
expect([1, 2, 3]).to start_with(1, 2)
expect([1, 2, 3]).to end_with(2, 3)

# aliases and compounding 

expect(['list', 'of', 'words']).to start_with(
  a_string_ending_with('st')
  ).and end_with(
  a_string_starting_with('wo')
)
```

all

The `all` matcher is somewhat of an oddity: it is the only built-in matter that is not a verb, and it is the only one that always takes another matcher as an argument:

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
expect(numbers).to all be_even
```
This expression does exactly what it says: it expects all the numbers in the array to be even.

One gotcha to be aware of is that, like `Enumerable#all?`, this matcher passes against an empty array. This can lead to surprises. Example:

```ruby
def self.evens_up_to(n = 0)
0.upto(n).select(&:odd?)
end
expect(evens_up_to).to all be_even
```
Our expectation didn‚Äôt fail and we forgot to pass an argument to `evens_up_to`

```ruby
RSpec::Matchers.define_negated_matcher :be_non_empty, :be_empty
expect(evens_up_to).to be_non_empty.and all be_even
```

We‚Äôre using another RSpec feature, define_negated_matcher, to create a new `be_non_empty` matcher that‚Äôs the opposite of `be_empty`.

Now, the expectation correctly flags the broken method as failing:

```ruby
expected `[].empty?` to return false, got true
```

Match

If you call JSON or XML APIs, you often end up with deeply nested arrays and hashes.

As you did with `eq`, you provide a data structure that‚Äôs laid out like the result you‚Äôre expecting. `match` is more flexible

```ruby
children = [
{ name: 'Coen', age: 6 },
{ name: 'Daphne', age: 4 },
{ name: 'Crosby', age: 2 }
]

expect(children).to match [
{ name: 'Coen', age: a_value > 5 },
{ name: 'Daphne', age: a_value_between(3, 5) },
{ name: 'Crosby', age: a_value < 3 }
]

#it works with strings too
expect('a string').to match(/str/)
expect('a string').to match('str')
```

Contain_exactly

We‚Äôve seen that match checks data structures more loosely than `eq`; `contain_exactly` is even looser. <b>The difference is that `match` requires a specific order, whereas `contain_exactly` ignores ordering.</b>

```ruby
expect(children).to contain_exactly(
{ name: 'Daphne', age: a_value_between(3, 5) },
{ name: 'Crosby', age: a_value < 3 },
{ name: 'Coen', age: a_value > 5 }
)
expect(children).to contain_exactly(
{ name: 'Crosby', age: a_value < 3 },
{ name: 'Coen', age: a_value > 5 },
{ name: 'Daphne', age: a_value_between(3, 5) }
)
```

Which collection matcher should I use?

With a half dozen collection matches to pick from, you may wonder which one is the best for your situation. In general, we <b>recommend you use the loosest matter that still specifies the behavior you care about.</b>

Using a loose matcher makes your specs less brittle: it prevents incidental details from causing an unexpected failure.

Quick reference for the different uses:

       style="width:600px;" />
</div>

Block matchers

With all the expectations we have seen so far, we have past regular Ruby objects into expect: 
```ruby
expect(3).to eq(3)

 this is fine for checking properties of your data. but sometimes you need to check properties of a piece of code. for example, perhaps a certain piece of code is supposed to raise an exception. 
```ruby
expect { raise 'boom' }.to raise_error('boom')
```

Rsbec will run the block and watch for the specific side effects you specify: exceptions, mutating variables, I/O and so on.

 Raising and throwing 

R s p e c provides matters for both of the situations: that are properly named race error and throw SYM

 race error

 first, let's look at race error also known as race exception. this matter is very flexible, supporting multiple forms:

 race error with no arguments match if any error is raised
 race error( some error class) matches if some error class or soup class is raised

 race error(‚Äòmessage error‚Äô) matches if an error is raised with a message exactly equal to a giving a string

 raise error(/some Rejects/) matches if an error is raised with a message matching a given pattern

 you can also combine these criteria if the class and the message are important 

raise_error(SomeErrorClass, "some message")
‚Ä¢ raise_error(SomeErrorClass, /some regex/)
‚Ä¢ raise_error(SomeErrorClass).with_message("some message")
‚Ä¢ raise_error(SomeErrorClass).with_message(/some regex/)

```ruby
expect {
'hello'.world
}.to raise_error(an_object_having_attributes(name: :world))
```
There are a couple of caches with race error that can lead can lead to false positives. furious, race error with no arguments will match any error and it cannot tell the difference between exceptions you did or did not mean to throw.

 for example if you rename a method but forget to update your spec on my Ruby will throw a effort ever. and over serious race Arrow will swallow this exception and respect will pass.

 always include some kind of detail ‚Äì either I specific custom ever class or a snippet from the message ‚Äì that is unique to the specific race statement you are testing

  throw symbol
 exceptions are designed for, well, exceptional situation such as an error in a program logic. they are not suited for everyday control flow, so just jumping out of a deeply nasty nasty look or a methyl. for situation like this, Ruby provides the Federal construct.

```ruby
expect { throw :found }.to throw_symbol(:found)

expect { throw :found, 10 }.to throw_symbol(:found, a_value > 9)
```

Yielding

 blocks are one of rubies most distinctive features. they allow you to pass around little chunks of code using an easy to read syntax 

```ruby
def self.just_yield
  puts "[just_yield] about to yield"
  yield
  puts "[just_yield] after yield"
end

RSpec.describe "yield_control demo" do
  it "shows the flow" do
    expect { |block_checker|
      puts "[expect block] calling just_yield with block_checker"
      just_yield(&block_checker)
      puts "[expect block] returned from just_yield"
    }.to yield_control
  end
end

#output
[expect block] calling just_yield with block_checker
[just_yield] about to yield
[just_yield] after yield
[expect block] returned from just_yield
```

You can also add with these Guild arguments, no arguments and successive arguments

 Mutation

 here we use the change matcher that will help you specify the sort of mutation you are expecting 

```ruby
array = [1, 2, 3]
expect { array << 4 }.to change { array.size }
```
The matcher performs the following actions in turn:
1. Run your change block and store the result, array.size, as the before value
2. Run the code under test, array << 4
3. Run your change block a second time and store the result, array.size, as the
after value
4. Pass the expectation if the before and after values are different

This expectation checks whether or not the expectation changed

If you need to be more specific and highlight the amount of the change you can use:

Specifically, you can use by, by_at_least, or by_at_most to specify the amount of the change:
```ruby
expect { array.concat([1, 2, 3]) }.to change { array.size }.by(3)
expect { array.concat([1, 2, 3]) }.to change { array.size }.by_at_least(2)
expect { array.concat([1, 2, 3]) }.to change { array.size }.by_at_most(4)
```
 and also we have the front and two if you want to know the exact before and after values 
```ruby
expect { array << 4 }.to change { array.size }.from(3)
expect { array << 5 }.to change { array.size }.to(5)
expect { array << 6 }.to change { array.size }.from(5).to(6)
expect { array << 7 }.to change { array.size }.to(7).from(6)
```
