Recently, I participated in a very competitive interview. When I submitted the code challenge, I felt my weakest area was the testing suite. Even though feedback was not available, being honest with myself and seeing some posts from the reviewers, I decided to dive deeper into testing. 

I picked up books like [Professional Rails Testing by Jason Swett](/2025/02/05/professional-rails-testing.html), [Hands-On Test Driven Development by Greg Donald](/2025/03/16-hands-on-tdd-rails.html), and Effective Testing with RSpec by Myron Marston and Ian Dees.

I had practiced testing before, but I felt it was time to level up and get it closer to the same standard as the rest of my code.

Here are the notes, examples, and quotes that stood out to me while reading.
