The book has a very practical approach (living up to its title "hands-on") where the author explains what you're going to build, which tools and why those tools. It's meant for beginner-intermediate developers.

The content follows a linear structure which means you should read chapters from the beginning to the end, in a straightforward manner, you'll follow him along as he codes the web app as you see the red-green-refactor cycle.

The outcome will be getting a better grasp of the benefits of applying Test-Driven Development (TDD), how to adopt this new mindset.
