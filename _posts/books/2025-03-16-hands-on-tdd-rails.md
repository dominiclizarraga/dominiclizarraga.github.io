The book has a very practical approach (living up to its title "hands-on") where the author explains what you're going to build, which tools and why those tools. It's meant for beginner-intermediate developers.

The content follows a linear structure which means you should read chapters from the beginning to the end, in a straightforward manner, you'll follow him along as he codes the web app as you see the red-green-refactor cycle.

The outcome will be getting a better grasp of the benefits of applying Test-Driven Development (TDD), how to adopt this new mindset.

### Introduction. {#chapter-1}

It was not so long ago that we did not even write tests for our software. At some point, some very smart people realize that writing tests for our software was actually a good idea. our tests will provide us with confidence that our software worked as expected and even more importantly keep us from getting phone calls in the middle of the night to fix things that would break in production.

Not long after we started writing tests, some other very smart people realize that writing our test first would give us an opportunity to think about what we were going to ride before we would write it. It will give us a target to aim at, in effect. This was the birth of test driven development tdd is a style of software development where we write our test first, see that they are failing as expected, and only then do we pursue writing the code to make those tests passed.

This is the central idea of my book. We will think about what we want to do, then we will capture that idea with a properly failing test. Then we will then write the code to make the test pass. After that, we will then we refactor our code to make it better, or prettier, or less repetitive.

We will use test driven development style of software design and engineering, which means we will write failing test first and only then write our implementation code to get our failing test passing.

We will use `Rspec` testing framework to write our test. `Rspec` describes itself as a tool for performing behavioral driven development and as in fact the best tool available for testing will be code.

The main goal of this book is to provide a practical common Hands-On introduction to test driven style of software design and engineering.

Many books on the topic of test driven development have been written before this one. Most other books are written in a small problem sort of writing style. They cover single topics, one of the time, barely more than a reference guy. They do not cover the entire process of building software application from start to finish, using TDD, as a result, they are, in my opinion, let's practical and much less useful for actually learning practical TDD.

The author states the following, <b>I have never seen software written using TDD that was not better than software written without TDD.</b>
