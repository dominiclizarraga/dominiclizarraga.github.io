# Session 9: Vary Verse

Date: October 04, 2025

This blog post consists in two parts:

- [My notes on Loosen Coupling](#coupling)
- [My notes on Find Shameless Green](#shameless-green)
- [My notes on New requirement: Vary the Bits](#vary-the-bits)


### Key Concepts

### Loosen Coupling {#coupling}

Watch 1: Choosing Which Units to Test

Unit tests are tests of just a single class and an integration test is a test that checks the collaboration of more than one single class.

The initial tests that we wrote back in Chapter 2 were unit tests to begin with because we just had that single `Bottles` class, and now they are badly out of date and they've long since been turned into integration tests.

The rule is every class should have a unit test.

All of these classes are being covered by the original tests that were unit tests but are now integration tests, and some of these new objects need their own unit tests now.

We think of tests as something that prevents regressions, as a way to prove that our code works correctly and to keep us from accidentally breaking things.

- Also, tests tell the story of the code
- Tests help to expose the design of the code that you have, and by that I mean, if the code is poorly designed it will be difficult to test

You can write incorrect, misleading tests around well-designed code. However, the converse isn't really true. It's really hard to write nice, neat, intention revealing tests around code that is poorly designed.

<b>You can think of tests as the first reuse of your code.</b>

When you write tests last, it's very common to find that is really difficult to test your code, and the reason is, it's very easy when you're just writing code to get a bunch of tight coupling, to have a bunch of objects that know way too much about each other such that they can only be used in combination with each other.
