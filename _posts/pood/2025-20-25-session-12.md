# Session 12: Conlusion of POOD

1. Go to you app and seek for Liskov violation

reduce what you get back when you send a message, implement a common interface, write test, then you can make a new class

2. Polymorphism, objects that play roles, we have confidence that objects do what i send them.

Find the conditional, same shape, same tests, that would be candidate to create small classes.

3. you need practice it

4. search one of those tools that looks over time in your repo how much has a big class changed, that needs refactoring.

5. it's cheaper to create objects, otherwhise you get mutating objects which is bad. Not mutating objects will make things simpler
