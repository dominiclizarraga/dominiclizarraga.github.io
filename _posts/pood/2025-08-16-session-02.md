# Session 2: Test Driving Shameless Green

Date: August 16, 2025  

### Key Concepts

In this lesson, our main task was to watch Sandi Metz’s talk, study her code, and then answer six questions about it. Afterward, we turned to the book 99 Bottles to compare our answers with Sandi’s own. 

The real challenge, however, wasn’t just about finding the “right” answer, it was about learning how to justify our decisions. Could we explain our reasoning clearly enough to convince other programmers that our solution (or Sandi’s) was the better one? Working in a team of three, we debated each approach and practiced the art of defending design choices.
