# Session 3: Identify Abstractions & Dry Out Shameless Green

Date: August 23, 2025

This blog post consists in two parts:

- [My notes on Identify Abstractions](#identify-abstractions)
- [My notes on code Dry Out Shameless Green"](#dry-out-shame-less)

### Identify Abstractions {#identify-abstractions}

Watch 1: Following the Flocking Rules

âœ¨ <i>Quick reminder: We need to change the code to display "six-pack" instead of "6 bottles" which means make the code open to extension, closed to modification</i>

Here are the steps to find abstractions in code, these are mini-decisions, we still don't know the outcome:

1. Select the things that are most alike
2. Find the smallest difference between them
3. Make the simplest change to remove the difference

a) parse the new code
b) parse and execute it
c) parse, execute and use its results
d) deleted unused code

Remember to 

- change one line at the time.
- run tests after each change
- if the test fail, undo and make a better change

Set of rules of flocking birds

- alignment: tells them to steer on the average heading of their near neighbors
- cohesion, says steer towards the average position of their neighbors, which is sort of a long range attraction rule
- separation, don't hit each other

This will turn difference into sameness and will reveal Concealed Concepts.

Watch 2: Converging on Abstractions

Increase isolation of the thing we want to vary. With the hope that eventually the code will open for the change we want to make.

Discover hidden abstractions instead of look at the problem and make them up.

We went from this code:

```ruby

  def verse(number)
    case number
    when 0
      "No more bottles of beer on the wall, " +
      "no more bottles of beer.\n" +
      "Go to the store and buy some more, " +
      "99 bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
    when 1
      "1 bottle of beer on the wall, " +
      "1 bottle of beer.\n" +
      "Take it down and pass it around, " +
      "no more bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
    when 2
      "2 bottles of beer on the wall, "
      "2 bottles of beer.\n " +
      "Take one down and pass it around," +
      "1 bottle of beer on the wall.\n"
    else
      "#{number} bottles of beer on the wall, " +
      "#{number} bottles of beer.\n " +
      "Take one down and pass it around, " +
      "#{number-1} bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
    end
  end
```

To this one, always following flocking rules for finding hidden abstracions, select the things that are most alike, find the smallest difference between them and make the simplest change to remove the difference

```ruby

  def verse(number)
    case number
    when 0
      "No more bottles of beer on the wall, " +
      "no more bottles of beer.\n" +
      "Go to the store and buy some more, " +
      "99 bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
    when 1
      "1 bottle of beer on the wall, " +
      "1 bottle of beer.\n" +
      "Take it down and pass it around," +
      "no more bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
    else
      "#{number} #{container(number)} of beer on the wall, " +
      "#{number} bottles of beer.\n" +
      "Take one down and pass it around, " +
      "#{number-1} bottles of beer on the wall.\n"
    end
  end

  def container(number)
    if number == 1
      "bottle"
    else
      "bottles"
    end
  end
```
