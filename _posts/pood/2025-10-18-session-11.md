# Session 11: Escalation, Loosen Coupling in Tests & Nothing is Something

Date: October 18, 2025

This blog post consists in four parts:

- [My notes on Escalation](#escalation)
- [My notes on Loosen Coupling in Tests](#loosen-coupling)
- [My notes on Glory in One Final Easy Change](#easy-change)
- [My notes on Nothing is Something](#nothing-is-something)

### Key Concepts

### Escalation {#inheritescalationance}

This block introduces a new requirement: Escalation #2-Mix up Actors and Actions.  This triggers a whole bunch of refactorings and writing of new tests, after which the code ends up both simpler and more abstract.

Watch 1: Seeking Abstractions

New requirement is split the data into two arrays, one named 'actor' and the other 'action'.

Example:

```ruby
# The trailing 'that' in each line below separates the actor
# 'the horse and the hound and the horn' or 'the rooster that crowed in the morn'
# from action
# 'that belong to'
# 'that woke'
#
# Create another variant that randomly mixes actors and actions.
# ------------actor-----------------------action---------
# Thus, 'the priest all shaven and shorn' 'that killed', etc.
```

As you work, consider these questions:

1. Should you split the `DATA` into two arrays, one named 'actor' and the other 'action'? Or is there a more general way to satisfy the actor/action requirement?

2. This is the first requirement that involves that `DATA` array.  Is it time to isolate the `DATA` in a separate class?

3. If the `DATA` moves to a separate class which is then injected back into `House`, should the injected data come in the correct order, or should `House` still be responsible for ordering it?

As we look here at the current `House` class, if you were to ask yourself, "Does it have more than one responsibility?" or perhaps "If it did two things, what would those two things be?" the answer is, probably, the `DATA` feels like one kind of thing, and the code, the algorithm, feels like another.

Let's start by writing some tests before we extract `DATA` from `House`:

```ruby
