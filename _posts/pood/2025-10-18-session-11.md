# Session 11: Escalation, Loosen Coupling in Tests & Nothing is Something

Date: October 18, 2025

This blog post consists in four parts:

- [My notes on Escalation](#escalation)
- [My notes on Loosen Coupling in Tests](#loosen-coupling)
- [My notes on Glory in One Final Easy Change](#easy-change)
- [My notes on Nothing is Something](#nothing-is-something)

### Key Concepts

### Escalation {#inheritescalationance}

This block introduces a new requirement: Escalation #2-Mix up Actors and Actions.  This triggers a whole bunch of refactorings and writing of new tests, after which the code ends up both simpler and more abstract.

Watch 1: Seeking Abstractions

New requirement is split the data into two arrays, one named 'actor' and the other 'action'.

Example:

```ruby
# The trailing 'that' in each line below separates two things: 'actor' and 'action'
# actors:
# 'the horse and the hound and the horn' or 'the rooster that crowed in the morn'
#
# actions
# 'that belong to' or'that woke'
#
# Create another variant that randomly mixes actors and actions.
# ------------actor-----------------------action---------
# Thus, 'the priest all shaven and shorn', 'that killed', etc.

```

As you work, consider these questions:

1. Should you split the `DATA` into two arrays, one named 'actor' and the other 'action'? Or is there a more general way to satisfy the actor/action requirement?

2. This is the first requirement that involves that `DATA` array.  Is it time to isolate the `DATA` in a separate class?

3. If the `DATA` moves to a separate class which is then injected back into `House`, should the injected data come in the correct order, or should `House` still be responsible for ordering it?

As we look here at the current `House` class, if you were to ask yourself, "Does it have more than one responsibility?" or perhaps "If it did two things, what would those two things be?" the answer is, probably, the `DATA` feels like one kind of thing, and the code, the algorithm, feels like another.

Let's start by writing some tests for the new classes before we extract `DATA` from `House`:

```ruby
class OriginalOrdererTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_order
    input = %w(a b c d e)
    expected = input
    assert_equal expected, OriginalOrderer.new.order(input)
  end
end

class RandomOrdererTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_order
    Random.srand(1)
    input = %w(a b c d e)
    puts input
    expected = %w(c b e a d)
    assert_equal expected, RandomOrderer.new.order(input)
    Random.srand
  end
end

class RandomLastOrdererTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_order
    Random.srand(1)
    input = %w(a b c d e always_last_item)
    expected = %w(c b e a d always_last_item)
    assert_equal expected, RandomLastOrderer.new.order(input)
    Random.srand
  end
end
```

This is the code so far once we have extracted the `DATA` into its own class, making sure it provides the right order since it's not a `House` responsability:

```ruby
class Phrases
    DATA =
    [ ["the horse and the hound and the horn", "that belonged to"],
      ["the farmer sowing his corn", "that kept"],
      ["the rooster that crowed in the morn", "that woke"],
      ["the priest all shaven and shorn", "that married"],
      ["the man all tattered and torn", "that kissed"],
      ["the maiden all forlorn", "that milked"],
      ["the cow with the crumpled horn", "that tossed"],
      ["the dog", "that worried"],
      ["the cat", "that killed"],
      ["the rat", "that ate"],
      ["the malt", "that lay in"],
      ["the house", "that Jack built"]
    ]

  attr_reader :data

  def initialize(orderer: OriginalOrderer.new)
    @data = orderer.order(DATA)
  end

  def phrase(num)
    data.last(num).join(" ")
  end

  def size
    data.size
  end
end

class House
  attr_reader :phrases, :prefix

  def initialize(phrases: Phrases.new, prefixer: MundanePrefixer.new)
    @phrases = phrases
    @prefix = prefixer.prefix
  end

  def recite
    1.upto(phrases.size).collect {|i| line(i)}.join("\n")
  end

  def phrase(num)
    phrases.phrase(num)
  end

  def line(num)
    "#{prefix} #{phrase(num)}.\n"
  end
end


class RandomOrderer
  def order(data)
    data.shuffle
  end
end

class OriginalOrderer
  def order(data)
    data
  end
end

class RandomLastOrderer
  def order(data)
    data[0..-2].shuffle << data.last
  end
end

class PiratePrefixer
  def prefix
    "Thar be"
  end
end

class MundanePrefixer
  def prefix
    "This is"
  end
end

puts
phrases = Phrases.new(orderer: OriginalOrderer.new)
puts House.new(phrases: phrases).line(12)
```
