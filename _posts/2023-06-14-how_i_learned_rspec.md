**Rspec learning resources**

The best way to get a grasp of testing and *rspec* in general is to start from scratch a project and start writing down each test, that way you'll be able to see what happens if you forget to close either a `context` block or `it` block or even more intricate subjects like what's the difference between `describe` and `context`.

While developing a freelance project I wanted to add testing as a way to push myself to learn more about testing and also give *rspec* a try and by doing it I learned how to use gems like: [faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker), [shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers), [factory_bot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot_rails) and finally [rspec](rspec-rails). ðŸŽ²

You'll additionally acquire the difference between `create` and `build` [more details.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14098031/whats-the-difference-between-the-build-and-create-methods-in-factorygirl); how to integrate devise  with rspec [blog](https://henrytabima.github.io/rails-setup/docs/devise/test-helpers) or difference between `fixtures` and `factories` and finally what does <mark>config.include FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods</mark> actually do?

```json
# build doesn't persist 
user = build(:user, name: "John")
expect(user.name).to eq("John")

# create does persist 
user = create(:user, name: "Jane")
expect(user.persisted?).to be true
```
