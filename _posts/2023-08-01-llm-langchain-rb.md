While I was in New York I had the opportunity to attend a [nyc.rb](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/nyc-rb/) webinar where the main subject to discuss was going to be LLMs and what is the Ruby community doing about, [Andrei Bondarev](https://twitter.com/rushing_andrei) was the speaker.

I know it was a webinar you can attend it wherever you are! However I found it because I was looking for a monthly meeting in NY, also I found that [NYC on rails](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/nyc-on-rails/) is about to start so folks from NY please support [Avi](https://twitter.com/aviflombaum) in this journey üôè.

[Tweet](https://twitter.com/aviflombaum/status/1686015466290991107) where Avi anounces that he is going to take up rails monthly meeting (they were held off since 2016).

OK moving on from ads here I'll share with you the resources that I have gone over the last week so I got my feet wet with this new topic called LLMs (Large Language Models).

What is LLMs? 

It's a subset of Deep Learning as well as Generative AI, both belong to AI.

What is langchain then? ü¶ú

How LLMs work?
