While I was in New York I had the opportunity to attend a [nyc.rb](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/nyc-rb/) webinar where the main subject to discuss was going to be LLMs and what is the Ruby community doing about.

I know it was a webinar you can take wherever you are! However I found it because I was looking for a monthly meeting in NY, also I found that [NYC on rails](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/nyc-on-rails/) is about to start so folks from NY please support [Avi](https://twitter.com/aviflombaum) in this journey 🙏.
