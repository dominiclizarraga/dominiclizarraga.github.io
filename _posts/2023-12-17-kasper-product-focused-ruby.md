1. Have a problem definition.

2. In a rails context, start with a controller and start figuring out how to pass stuff to the view (it will give you a lot of constraints already).

3. Then sketch stuff out like write methods that reflect "complete" and "uncomplete", don't focus on assigning instance variables, inheritance of the controller (you save this for later).

4. At this point we have how routes are going to be. What are going to be the "resources" are they going to be nested?

We have figured out the organizational stuff around things. So now we know how to put into business logic and complete it.
