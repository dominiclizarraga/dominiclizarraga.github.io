    <title>UML inventor interview (Grady Booch) | notes</title>
    <link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/12/15/uml-inventor.html"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7WaC429YcU&amp;amp;t=1144s&quot;&gt;Full interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language&quot;&gt;UML&lt;/a&gt; creator defines UML as reason tool, not coding! Also invented object oriented analysis and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM fellow is a distinguished role where he seeks to do improvements for the next 5-10 years, as Alan Kay said: The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was after automating discovery patterns in legacy code way before LLM’s (didn’t continue the project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment you write a code it becomes “legacy” until you throw it away, even when it’s very small, it has a cost, has to be maintainable, tech debt, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~60s IRS population increased and paperwork was too much that was not able to be done by hand so a new process of automation with Fortran came (they used to close earlier in order to reconcile accounts) that code is still running, mostly business rules plus the government still issuing more rules YOY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complex systems started with the defense department (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Automatic_Ground_Environment&quot;&gt;SAGE&lt;/a&gt; 50s-80s) before satellites and radars, around this time NATO was created and they aimed to fix this problem. (Golden age of software)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premise back in the day was to build monolith systems that were sustainable over time with algorithmic languages (Cobol, Fortran).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The transition from monoliths to distributed systems initially with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA&quot;&gt;DARPA&lt;/a&gt; was funded by the government and having an email was pretty difficult only a thousand people had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue started to be more noticeable when they wanted to scale the system with algorithmic decomposition, they needed software that work in a variety of computers, multi-lingual, distributed and real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late 70s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk&quot;&gt;Smalltalk&lt;/a&gt; arose and the government had an issue that all their systems were using different languages so they wanted to unify them to only one, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;Ada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ada was far ahead of its time, it used the ideas of abstract data types, which was extremely new back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new Ada wave brought the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booch_method&quot;&gt;Booch method&lt;/a&gt; (1979) this is the 2nd golden era of software where they dealt with system distributed problems not only algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grady came up with the Booch method by reading many sources but one that caught his attention was Plato and his quote “how one should best see the world? As processes or as atoms” the latter was more inclined to OOP (classes and objects, behavior). (among other philosophical sources)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~1950 subroutines were considered a bad practice/controversial because doing a function call added 2 or 3 more instructions, now is seen normal, this was before the Booch method and thinking in classes and objects, now we take that for granted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of UML was to look at the software from multiple points of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before data orientation, people who write COBOL used to print every day a document called “common data” as a matter of practice not due to language so that the whole team had the abstractions on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grady and his partners after spending some years in defense they moved to commercial space and built &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Rose&quot;&gt;ROSE&lt;/a&gt; which helped the teams to write UML diagrams easily, only as a design tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market then asked “now we have an arpanet and these personal computers, how do we keep building software?”  and that was the time that the concept of “use-cases” was conceived, it was very strange to look through it back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UML helped people along Microsoft VScode to drive more complex software because now they have these two that most people can use and write code depicting entities relationships responsibilities and that increase the complexity on the systems (maybe LLM will enable us to develop more complex software?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the.com hype people realized that the companies or products that were developed we’re not economically sustainable (maybe all the microapps we currently have?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why u m l is not longer used in modern software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grady’s outlooks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big companies have exposed their apis therefore there is no much architectural thinking and company keeps building on top of it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Startups for instance they just built with others people money and if it fails it doesn’t matter so I don’t have formality I just want to build something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another example if I build an airplane software I want more discipline and I want more ceremony so uml is going to be part of&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also if I’m building a defense software and someone may die i want formality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also if I’m going to build something that people have built in the past again and again I don’t need uml for instance the users profiles or liking a post I just prompted the LLM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the other hand if I’m going to build something that I have never seen before something really complex that’s the sweet spot for UML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;James Webb space telescope uses UML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economicals on software has changed, back in the day a computer was more expensive than a human so you have to spend more time thinking about the algorithm before trying it out now that has changed and you take that for granted but the competitional resources were very scarce&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the role of software architect: “All architecture is designed but to all design is architecture” It represents significant design decisions that shape the form and shape of the system where significant is measured by cost of change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above paragraph reminded me of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Successful (working) but undesigned applications carry the seeds of their own destruction; they are easy to write, but gradually become impossible to change.”
― Sandi Metz&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire history of software engineering is rising levels of  abstraction, and that’s what we are currently seeing at very high level of abstraction that does not require any more the system decision which back in the day was bread and butter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the decisions that have to be made are what cloud service I use? What message system do I use or what platform? Which are economic decisions, should I use AWS for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very interesting comment from Grady was that if you are a startup you’re going to hire someone who has done this before because they know the caveats of these new “architectural decision” in this case let’s say AWS because this guy has work on it before and he already knows it’s limitations and how far it can go, the costs and so forth therefore they can accelerate your development because they have more expertise on this and now these are “systemic decisions” because they have economic impact (even on the long term)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another bite from Grady Regarding why migrations are very hard to carry out  is that you aim to build economically feasible software but technology is changing out of you so you that makes you think that you need to change either a new framework or where is the background jobs for the calculations being done either on the server or the mobile for instance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The code is is the truth but the code is not the whole truth” this quote again is for design decisions and sits around that you cannot just focus on what’s the best approach to this problem where is the most optimized solution for this because it involves hardware and even society, even culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A comparable change in history like that recent AI has brought can be when software went from being developed just to one monolith across different computers like a distributed systems systems,  that forced us to rethink how we design systems because now you are able to have it either on your mobile or your PC (lates 70s)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time many changes came for instance &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing&quot;&gt;time-sharing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://timeline.ll.mit.edu/timeline/&quot;&gt;whirlwind computers&lt;/a&gt; then mini computers (digital) with help of semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of distributed systems can be like new LLMS.
The perfect storm for AI was having Andrew NG discovering that the matrix multiplication that the NVIDIA GPU us were doing for more realistic game development was the ones that they need for deep learning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grady’s take on LLM: based on his vast experience on AI and now that he has 6 years researching the brain and its parts, he concludes that LLMs are unreliable narrators based on their architecture, they allow us to build scale bullshit generators, like stochastic parrots. The result is coherent though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not going to hit AGI by scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For new folks joining the market: -You will always need people to make informed decisions, tools change, it’s another level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a place yourself where no one else is there and make your name there. There are plenty of spaces in the computer field, lastly have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Perspectives-Emerging-Discipline/dp/0131829572&quot;&gt;Books recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intercom Off Script series | notes</title>
    <link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/10/12/intercom-off-script.html"/>
    <updated>2024-10-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://localhost:4000/2024/10/12/intercom-off-script</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here I wrote down some notes after watcihng the Intercom Off-script series about how they are facing the AI age and how the see it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcj7mVY3fJs&amp;amp;list=PLlCIldMZCaFppymtNp4dUWmlkgyCbGEHh&quot;&gt;Youtube playlist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video #1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;technology comes and goes,you gotta fall in love with the problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;think of the core problem of your business, not the tech stack or framework&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;work is always the same, if you want to send something you used to send it on a horse, now you use ups or fedex, want to entertain people? first it was newspaper now it’s smartphones.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the quickest to adapt, not the strongest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;does AI would change something in my process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will blow up the total address of all Market because it will and I will customers or users who know what they want to do however they don’t know how to do it for instance in Excel or monday.com, salesforce who are great product very robust products but not so many people know how to use them, AI  will enable them to use them at its maximum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to rebuild our products our societies around this new technology and it is day one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video #2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being disturbing pollution change and reshape our society because before that everything was made by hand and after that breakthrough moment we were able to have houses cars clothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also technology is like a one-way street that once you go and cross that door you never look back before for instance once we had the iPhone in our hands we did not think about the traditional phone call or mail post&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What matters the most is that customers and businesses get greater experiences, it boils down to it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video #3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention algorithm and then wrap up with a Transformer machine learning technique Then the Transformer was trained with the huge amount of data that never before And finally it seems like it is understanding and it is capable to do some summarizing words follow some instructions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of what AI needs was when governments increase their budget in order to roll out new highways because they saw that as much highways and streets interconnected you have the more trade Commerce and tourist activity you will get in this case AI needs more compute infrastructure and so on (Things happen fast when the value is there and apparently AI is delivering some value)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently it is learning because it is paying attention to the important things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s got some limitations but you can’t work around those limitations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say that it is just a talking prediction like predicting the next word on the sentence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RAG Is given the llm more context in order to make it understand the current situation therefore it will provide a more accurate answer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a small series of tasks That you can really over-delivery on, not too broad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have used openAI models as building blocks, Maybe five or 10 different prompts Underneath the hood, Each of them doing a specific task like search for this customer in the db,  then get their last order, then disambiguate this question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an engineering perspective take five things your product should do and isolate them And get AI to do that task separately&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video #4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mother sauce and software in general seems to be very complicated and clunky because they serve a broad amount of users, It’s like cities in general they are designed for a general audience not for cyclist or pet owners or car drivers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with AI you can have UI design that is generated on the Fly based on the user request instead of having a form where users submits email phone number number order it will go and retrieve those data from the database and make up a new form just to confirm that the information is correct and it will be completely Custom Tailor to each requested and even to each user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It raises the floor for the designers, the human touch becomes more valued&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wear a drummer in the 80s and you see that a rhythm controller has come out you would thought that you are cooked but it happened all the opposite more drummers came to play their songs (democratizacion of music) So you don’t need to become a master at your craft in order to make music&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;however there still need of people who are a master at the craft even when AI provides shortcuts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Embrace the squiggle (process of designing something, converge, diverge ideas, discussions, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video #5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better, faster cheaper on online business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer service in businesses prior the war was more personal they made individual transactions,  and then as the business expanded they needed to hire more customer service in order to make it more Global more professional and then after that the 01800  phone lines came up and that was the time that the call centers started then with computers and internet the email and then the CRM too, chatbots, etc,  also how customers leave feedback from the service they got and that was a time where you needed a quality customer service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easiest decision is to cut people in order to make profit…&lt;br /&gt;
So in order to increase the quality of your customer service at the internet scale is very difficult&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video #6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big boys and small are no longer selling software seats to humans, but software doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t pay for CS, we pay what’s in the receipt, and CS is all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a internet business bring the benefits of scales which is selling around the clock, around the globe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heretofore (before now, new word)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agents gen1 (conversation, text boxes) and gen 2 (more familiar, proactive and take action)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cannibalize themselves if they want to survive and Netflix did with their shipping DVD business before streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Refactoring and testing a long method in Ruby on Rails</title>
    <link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/02/17/refactoring-and-testing.html"/>
    <updated>2024-02-17T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/17/refactoring-and-testing</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, we had the opportunity to refactor a lengthy method in a Ruby on Rails project. The method had multiple conditional statements (around 6) that checked various aspects of a project, such as whether it was discarded, on time, accepting entries, and more. Refactoring this method required careful planning and testing to ensure that the functionality remained intact while improving the code’s maintainability and readability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the refactoring process, we first focused on writing tests that covered all the edge and corner cases. To do this, we wrote tests that checked the opposite of what the method was currently doing. For each conditional statement, we created a test that verified the expected behavior when the condition was met and when it was not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of how we tested a condition that checked if a project was able to receive entries using FactoryBot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# In the test file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;Project entries&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;should not accept entries when the project is not set to receive entries&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;FactoryBot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;receive_entries: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Assert that the project does not accept entries&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;accept_entries?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_falsey&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;should accept entries when the project is set to receive entries&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;FactoryBot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;receive_entries: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Assert that the project accepts entries&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;accept_entries?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;be_truthy&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By writing tests for both scenarios (project accepting entries and not accepting entries), we ensured that the refactored method would handle these cases correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had a comprehensive test suite in place and all the tests were passing, we started the refactoring process. It’s important to remember that refactoring aims to modify the internal structure of the code without changing its external behavior. The goal is to improve performance, maintainability, and readability while adhering to the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the refactoring, we focused on breaking down the long method into smaller, more manageable chunks. we extracted common functionality into separate methods and aimed to reduce the complexity of the conditional statements. Here’s a simplified example of how the refactored method might look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;process_project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;discarded?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;on_time?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unless&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;accept_entries?&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Process the project&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By separating the conditions into individual guard clauses, the method becomes more readable and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the refactoring process, we continuously ran the tests to ensure that the functionality remained intact and that we didn’t introduce any unintended changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refactoring a long method can be a challenging task, especially for beginners. However, by following a systematic approach of writing comprehensive tests, breaking down the method into smaller parts, and focusing on improving maintainability and readability, you can successfully refactor your code and make it more manageable for future changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember 🎗️, refactoring is an iterative process, and it’s okay to take small steps and gradually improve your code over time. By consistently applying good coding practices and seeking feedback from more experienced developers, you can continuously enhance your refactoring skills and write cleaner, more maintainable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Breaking down the method into smaller, more manageable pieces.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Applying the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle to eliminate redundancy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enhancing performance and maintainability to ensure the code could be easily modified in the future.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Follow as Polymorphic</title>
    <link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/02/07/follow-as-polymorphic.html"/>

    <id>http://localhost:4000/2024/02/07/follow-as-polymorphic</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I’ll share my findings when developing a Follow model (User can follow another User, Post, Comapny) with a polymorphic property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the next models you can create a ‘Following’ feature that can be applied to almost any model you want, just add one line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ApplicationRecord&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Users that follow this user &apos;Followers&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;has_many&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:followers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;class_name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;Follow&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;as: :followable&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Entities this user follows &apos;Following&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;has_many&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:following&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;class_name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;Follow&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;foreign_key: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;user_id&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Follow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ApplicationRecord&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;belongs_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# who is making/pushing the button &quot;Follow&quot; (doing the following)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;belongs_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:followable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;polymorphic: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This validation doesn&apos;t allow that user_1 follow user_2 twice&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;validates&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;uniqueness: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;scope: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:followable_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:followable_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try out the code in rails console&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rails&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;u1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;first&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;u2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;last&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;follow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;u1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;following&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;followable: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;u2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Follow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;3.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;INSERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;INTO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;follows&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;user_id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;followable_type&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;followable_id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;created_at&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;updated_at&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;created_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Thu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Feb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;17.215129000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;updated_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Thu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Feb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;17.215129000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked for other models like (Post, Company, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ApplicationRecord&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;has_many&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:followers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;class_name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;Follow&apos;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;as: :followable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;following&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;followable: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;TRANSACTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;COMMIT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#&amp;lt;Follow:0x0000000150038080&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;id: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;user_id: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;followable_type: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Post&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;followable_id: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;92&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;created_at: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Thu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;29&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Feb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;56&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;29.921783000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve explored creating a follower system in Rails, showcasing the flexibility of polymorphic associations and the importance of validations. This guide provides a solid foundation for adding social functionalities to your Rails applications, ensuring a robust and scalable feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>http://localhost:4000/2024/01/26/action-policy-cache</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I worked with an app that was using Action Policy, I noticed that those policies were being called almost everywhere! So I started a small research and found that there was a section for cache authorizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in with Redis and how policies are saved in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the official (docs)[https://actionpolicy.evilmartians.io/#/caching] for combinig action policy + cache.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>http://localhost:4000/2024/01/22/when-you-see-the-count</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working on improving the app performance and have learnt about how&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.count&lt;/code&gt; works and how it can slow down the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a solution we have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter_cache&lt;/code&gt;provided by default by rails and also something more advance like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;counter_culture&lt;/code&gt;gem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it can improve you app as well!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Avoiding N+1 Queries 🚓</title>
    <link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/01/18/the-where-clause.html"/>
    <updated>2024-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://localhost:4000/2024/01/18/the-where-clause</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When optimizing an app, I recently learned to pay attention to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.where&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.find&lt;/code&gt; methods inside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.each&lt;/code&gt; loops because they can be potential candidates for association preloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is that for each element we iterate over, another operation will be executed, in this case &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.where&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.find&lt;/code&gt;, which can lead to an N+1 query problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Controller action&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# View template&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% @posts.each &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= post.title %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  # This will trigger separate query for each post to fetch the author
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Author: &amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# This will trigger separate query for each post to fetch the comments&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= post.comments.count %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL produced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;-- 1 for Post.all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;-- 2 for each post&apos;s author and comments count, this can get really worse&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;authors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;authors&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;authors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;LIMIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;COUNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;comments&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;comments&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;post_id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;post_id&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid this we can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.includes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Controller action&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# we eagerly load the author and comments for all the posts in a single query&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;includes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# View template&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;% @posts.each &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= post.title %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Author: &amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Comments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= post.comments.count %&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL produced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sql highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;-- 1 for Post.includes(:author, :comments), which eagerly loads the associated author and comments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;-- The number of queries is reduced to 3 (1 for posts, 1 for authors, 1 for comments), regardless of the number of posts.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;authors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;authors&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;authors&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;comments&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;comments&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;comments&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;&quot;post_id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative is to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.eager_load&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.includes&lt;/code&gt;. The difference is that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.includes&lt;/code&gt; uses separate queries to load the associations, while &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.eager_load &lt;/code&gt;uses a single query with a LEFT_OUTER_JOIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2023/12/06/n-+-1-queries.html&quot;&gt;Here I have a deeper blog about it!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to highlight that you must be careful of those &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;where&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;find_by&lt;/code&gt; inside of loops!&lt;/p&gt;
